	It is not a secret Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolutionizing the world for some time now. However, the release of <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">chatGPT</a> was a game changer, bringing Large Language Models (LLMs) in a productized and free way to the masses.
	This amazing tool has been also adopted by academics, whether they admit it or not. 
	In this context, using AI tools in academia is still debated for multiple moral, legal, and operational reasons. 
	Nonetheless, the end is clear - we will use AI as we use computers, the internet, and grammar correction models. 
	This is a question of when the old academics will understand they can not hold the gate closed much longer. 
</p>
<p>
	Indeed, the integration of AI has become an invaluable asset for educators and researchers alike, as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13040-023-00339-9">multiple studies</a> already show. 
	In the ever-evolving landscape of higher education, where the pursuit of knowledge is as dynamic as the digital age itself, AI tools are proving to be indispensable companions. 
	Well, these are all big words (which ChatGPT helped me to write). So, let us make it particular - shall we? 
	In this blog post, I will share with you five AI tools that have significantly streamlined various aspects of my academic life. 
	From simplifying grading processes to enhancing research efficiency, these tools are not just innovations; they are transformative aides that are reshaping the way we approach teaching, research, and overall scholarly pursuits. 
</p>
<h2>ChatGPT</h2>
<p>
	Well, it is only reasonable to start with the most popular tool - chatGPT. 
	This tool is very powerful as it can be used for multiple tasks. 
	Mainly, it is a writing companionship tool. As academics often face the challenge of articulating complex ideas or refining the language of their manuscripts, by integrating ChatGPT into their writing workflow, scholars can leverage their natural language understanding capabilities to generate coherent and polished text. 
	This involves feeding the model with a draft or a set of ideas and instructing it to refine the content, ensuring clarity and conciseness. 
	Additionally, ChatGPT's ability to suggest alternative phrasing, correct grammar, and enhance overall readability proves invaluable in producing scholarly articles, research papers, and other written materials. It is important to note, that do not ask chatGPT to write from scratch - this is usually a bad idea.
</p>
<p>
	ChatGPT can also serve as a virtual research assistant, aiding academics in information retrieval and synthesis. 
	By inputting specific queries or topics, scholars can prompt the model to provide succinct summaries or analyses, helping them quickly navigate through a sea of information. 
	Please make sure you use chatGPT-4 which has the ability to query the internet. Using chatGPT-3.5 will result in sub-optimal answers.
	The versatility of ChatGPT as a virtual research assistant extends to tasks like formulating research questions, brainstorming ideas, and generating hypotheses, enhancing the overall efficiency of scholarly inquiry.
</p>
<h2>Grammarly</h2>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> is not designed for academia in mind. However, this does not mean it is not working amazingly for academic writting. 
	Grammarly's primary function is to check for grammatical errors, punctuation issues, and spelling mistakes. Academics can use Grammarly to ensure that their writing is free from common language errors, thereby maintaining a professional and polished appearance for their work.
	In addition, it provides suggestions for improving writing style and tone which is particularly beneficial for those who want to convey their ideas in a clear and concise manner and English is not their first language.
	The tool can help in avoiding overly complex sentences or unclear phrasing, making the text more accessible to a broader audience.
	As a bonus, it includes a plagiarism detection feature that can be beneficial for academics to ensure the originality of their work. 
	By highlighting potential instances of unintentional plagiarism, the tool helps scholars maintain academic integrity and avoid any ethical issues related to the use of external content.
</p>
<h2>Scite</h2>
<p>
	<a href="https://scite.ai/">Scite</a> can play a crucial role in facilitating literature reviews and critical analyses by aiding academics in key tasks such as actively evaluating publications, comprehending the citation patterns surrounding a publication and its findings, and identifying pertinent literature related to the given topic. 
	Importantly, for academics, delving into prior work serves not only to contextualize their current research but also to pinpoint and articulate the existing gaps in the research landscape that their work aims to address. 
	In this context, Scite proves instrumental in the process of uncovering and elucidating research gaps.
</p>
<h2>EndNote</h2>
<p>
	<a href="https://endnote.com/">EndNote</a> 
	For example, with the introduction of a new data restoration feature in EndNote 21, you have the ability to recover your entire library and its structure, safeguarding your valuable research from potential loss. Additionally, the functionality of single-reference restoration allows you to compare and restore previous versions of individual references, providing you with a comprehensive and secure recovery process.
	Moreover, multiple tags can be assigned to a reference, and individuals with whom you've shared your library can easily view these tags. This makes tags an effective and intuitive method for swiftly organizing your references.
</p>
<h2>ResearchRabbit</h2>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.researchrabbit.ai/">ResearchRabbit</a> is a free online citation-based literature mapping tool. 
	It is a visual literature review software mapping tool that is similar to Spotify. The tool connects your research interests to related articles and authors. 
	Research Rabbit AI efficiently navigates extensive volumes of academic papers, journals, and research articles, swiftly extracting crucial information and summarizing pertinent content. This functionality proves to be a time-saving asset for researchers engaged in the thorough examination of the literature.
	Equipped with robust algorithms capable of extracting and analyzing data from diverse sources, the platform discerns patterns, trends, and correlations within the information, furnishing researchers with valuable insights to bolster their research objectives.
	Beyond individual support, the platform fosters collaboration among researchers by facilitating effortless sharing and access to research materials. Through real-time collaboration features, team members can engage in a seamless and efficient workflow.
