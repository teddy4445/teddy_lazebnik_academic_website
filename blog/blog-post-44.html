Are you drowning in todo lists? Do tasks keep slipping through the cracks, despite your best efforts to stay organized? I know the feeling.
For years, I battled against a never-ending backlog of tasks, feeling overwhelmed and unproductive - still do for sometimes. 
Basic todo lists simply were not cutting it. Who knows me for longer than a week, probably heared my deep (some may claim unhealthy) relationship with <a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwjZn4ODypCMAxW7OAYAHd3pJw8YABADGgJ3cw&co=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwkN--BhDkARIsAD_mnIrOGBShGyIhDZUajWQoH2Q6ug3622_j3uCzXI4c7ebu4IVRtCs9eSkaAtcCEALw_wcB&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESVOD2TZyzS3pa318oXw6Te0QPMIkwYf7QX-fS7t6sEtc5Rfm98i5RXubgMF3nWN7urq56g_cJ3sHIC6eKQRyB9amgDel_jCKVIfc2lvbG38p2U8pl1A&sig=AOD64_3ylUWi0OdLZln3voN4GoQaCiR1aw&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjUgP-CypCMAxU2BfsDHbVAN_EQ0Qx6BAgMEAE">Jira</a> as the best project managment tool in the wild.
However, Jira is overkill for most of stuff and I (unwillingly) acknowledge that. 
</p>
<p>
That is why I developed a more comprehensive system â€“ one that goes beyond simple lists to provide structure, context, and clarity. 
This system is not a silver bullet, but it is helped me regain control over my time and actually get things done. 
In this post, I will share the key elements of my task management and prioritization approach.
</p>

<h3>Core Principles of My System</h3>

<p>My system is built on four core principles that guide how I capture, organize, and execute my tasks:</p>

<h3>Project-Based Organization (The "Why")</h3>

<p>The biggest problem with a plain todo list is that tasks are often isolated and lack context. Instead of just listing tasks, I group them into projects with clear goals and deadlines. This gives me a much better understanding of *why* I'm doing something, which boosts my motivation.</p>

<p>Example: Instead of just having "Write Blog Post" on my list, I create a project called "Blog Content Strategy" (or a more specific project like, "Blog Post: Task Management System"). Within that project, I break down the tasks into smaller steps like: "Brainstorm Topics," "Outline Post," "Write First Draft," "Edit," "Add code snippets/images," etc.</p>

<p>Benefits: Greater context, increased motivation, a clearer sense of progress, and a satisfying feeling of accomplishment when a project is completed.</p>

<h3>Prioritization Matrix (The "What")</h3>

<p>Not all tasks are created equal. To effectively prioritize, I use a variation of the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important). However, I tweak it to be more specific to my goals, adding a column for "Impact" and "Effort."</p>

<p>Impact: How much will this task contribute to my long-term goals?</p>
<p>Effort: How much time and energy will this task require?</p>

<p>I rank each task on a scale of 1-5 for both Impact and Effort. Then, I calculate a score: <code>Impact / Effort = Priority</code> (higher score = higher priority). This helps me focus on high-impact, low-effort tasks first. This keeps me from spending too much time on tasks that aren't important in the long run. </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Let's say I have two tasks:</p>

<p>"Respond to Emails": Impact (2), Effort (3) = Priority (0.67)</p>
<p>"Develop New Feature for Side Project": Impact (5), Effort (4) = Priority (1.25)</p>

<p>Based on this matrix, developing the new feature is a higher priority than responding to emails (though I still need to respond to emails!). I use a simple Google Sheet to track this, with formulas to calculate the Priority score automatically.</p>

<h3>Time Blocking (The "When")</h3>

<p>Knowing <b>what</b> to do is only half the battle; knowing <b>when</b> to do it is just as important. I use time blocking in Google Calendar to allocate specific time slots for different types of tasks.</p>

<p>Example: I block out 2-3 hours every morning (typically 9 AM - 12 PM) for focused work on my most important coding projects. I also schedule dedicated time for email (30 minutes at 1 PM) and administrative tasks (1 hour on Friday afternoons).</p>

<p>Benefits: Protects focus time, promotes consistency, prevents task overload, and ensures that important tasks actually get done.</p>

<h3>Energy Level Awareness (The "How")</h3>

<p>This principle focuses on <b>how</b> I tackle tasks, rather than strictly scheduling them in a chronological order. I recognize that my energy levels fluctuate throughout the day. I'm most creative and energetic in the mornings and more fatigued in the afternoons.</p>

<p>Example: I am less productive on creative challenges late in the day. I've found it's much more effective to address these difficult projects in the morning. And save tasks such as paying bills and organizing financial reports for late in the day.</p>

<p>How this affects prioritization?: My system has to allow for flexibility. I might prioritize a tedious task that requires little brainpower over a creative task that requires extensive thought.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies (The "With What")</h3>

<p>Here are the specific tools I use to implement my task management system:</p>

<p>Todoist: This is my primary task management app. I use it to create projects, break down tasks into subtasks, set deadlines, and assign priorities. The integrations with other tools are also great.</p>
<p>Google Calendar: Essential for time blocking and scheduling. I use color-coding to visually distinguish between different types of tasks.</p>
<p>Google Sheets: I use this for my Prioritization Matrix, as well as for tracking project progress and other data.</p>
<p>Obsidian: For note-taking and knowledge management. I often link tasks to relevant notes and documentation.</p>

<p>How these tools are integrated: The biggest integration is Todoist to Google Calendar. Todoist allows you to see the scheduled tasks, helping me prioritize correctly.</p>

<h3>Practical Implementation (Putting It All Together)</h3>

<p>Here's a glimpse into my typical weekly routine:</p>

<p>Sunday Evening: I review my upcoming week, prioritize tasks in Todoist using my Impact/Effort matrix, and then block out time in Google Calendar accordingly.</p>
<p>Daily: I check Todoist first thing in the morning to see what is on the agenda. Throughout the day, I stick to my time blocks as much as possible, but I also remain flexible and adjust as needed.</p>
<p>Friday Afternoon: I review the past week, assess my progress on key projects, and plan for the upcoming week.</p>

<h3>Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them</h3>

<p>Procrastination: The best way to combat procrastination is to break down tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. If a task feels overwhelming, I try to identify the smallest possible action I can take to get started.</p>
<p>Unexpected Interruptions: Life happens. I build buffer time into my schedule to account for unexpected interruptions. If I get completely derailed, I try to re-prioritize and adjust my schedule for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Task Overload: It's easy to overcommit. I've learned to say "no" to new commitments that don't align with my priorities. I also regularly review my task list and prune tasks that are no longer relevant.</p>

<h3>Evolution and Continuous Improvement (The "Always Learning")</h3>

<p>My task management system is constantly evolving. I've experimented with different tools and techniques over the years, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my efficiency and productivity. For example, I recently started using Obsidian for note-taking, which has significantly improved my ability to connect tasks to relevant information. In the past I've used trello and asana. But they were too clunky and complicated.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Effective task management is crucial for productivity and overall well-being. It's not about working harder; it's about working smarter. By implementing a structured system like the one I've described, you can regain control over your time, focus on your priorities, and achieve your goals.</p>

<p>Don't try to implement everything at once! Start small. Pick one aspect of my system (e.g., project-based organization) and try implementing it this week. Then, gradually add other elements as you become more comfortable.</p>
