	In the realm of academia, collaboration is the cornerstone upon which groundbreaking research is built. 
	It is the fusion of diverse perspectives and expertise that often leads to innovative discoveries, as recent research repetitively concluded. 
	Nonetheless, this process is not without its challenges, as in any relationship. 
	The unspoken dynamics of academic collaboration can sometimes resemble a complex puzzle, where negotiation, credit attribution, and resource distribution play pivotal roles. 
	Unlike other fields of life, where a person can learn from adults, colleagues, or educators how to properly manage a relevant relationship; in the academic setting, the student entering academia is usually biased and guided with her advisor's objective in mind rather than herself.
	In this blog post, we delve into the systematic issues that often arise in academic collaboration and offer strategies to navigate these intricate waters gracefully.
</p>

	Unsurprisingly, the topic of academic collaboration and its intricacies have garnered significant attention in the research community. 
	Numerous studies have documented the potential pitfalls that can arise when individuals from different disciplines, institutions, or cultural backgrounds come together to work on a project.
	These works provide a non-biased, somewhat generic, overview of the situation and allow us to extract meaningful strategies. 
	Notwithstanding, before we dive into these strategies, some intresting numbers about this atrocious phenomenon.

	Successful collaboration is not about avoiding challenges entirely, but rather about approaching them constructively.
	By implementing these strategies and adapting them to your unique circumstances, you can increase the chances of a smooth and productive collaborative experience.
</p>
<h4>Learn and address power dynamics</h4>
<p>
	
</p>
<h4>Establish clear expectations before the project starts</h4>
<p>
	
</p>
<h4>Agreed author list order, communication style, and tasks to accomplish</h4>
<p>
	
</p>
<h4>Define mediation mechanisms</h4>
<p>
	
</p>
<h4>Establish (written) exit strategy</h4>
<p>
	While it's not pleasant to consider, having an exit strategy in place can be beneficial if collaborations need to be dissolved due to irreconcilable differences. 
	This strategy could involve clear guidelines for parting ways while minimizing disruption.
	It is of course easier said than done as the other parties (from the author's experience, the worse kind) would dismiss the subject. 
	In addition to the other parties' dismission, you may think it might harm an overall positive and important collaboration.
	To this end, let us consider the options rationally. If the other party does not worry about such scenarios, as everyone in the project would wish to avoid it, agreeing on some exit strategy should not be an issue as no one will ever use it.
	However, a party that avoids such an agreement is more often than not, keeping itself the option to play this card later in the game. 
	Hence, an exit strategy is usually a "must-have" in new and even ongoing collaborations. 
	Unlike the previous agreements we discussed in this blog post, this one should be written down and signed by all members of the project. 
	Think about it... You are using the exit strategy when all hopes to finish the project seem lost. It is expected that some heat is already present and the memory of some project members may "change" a bit about your original agreement.
	A written one would help with these cases - if not with the project members themselves, with the relevant bodies you can address (universities, funding bodies, etc.)
</p>

<p>
	Note, that while these strategies are indeed useful, they may make you look a bit "weird" in academia.
	It seems that academics expect each other to work on pure good-will and trust and just accept unpleasant events every now and then. 
	Trying to avoid this unpleasant experience as much as possible, may raise some eyebrows, especially of the older generation of academics.
	Thus, a personal balance between using these strategies and being so-called <i>naive</i> is recommended to enjoy the benefits of both approaches.

<h4>Acknowledgement</h4>
<p>
	At this point, I wish to thank all my academic collaborators. Some of them became my friends, others individuals in my block list on my phone, or left just as collaborators.
	However, in all cases, they taught me and made me the researcher and academic I am today.
