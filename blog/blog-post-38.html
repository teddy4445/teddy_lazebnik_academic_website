	Picking a PhD research topic is a daunting but crucial first (and continuous) step. 
	This topic will guide your journey for years to come, so it should be both engaging and academically sound. 
	But with so many possibilities, how do you narrow it down? How to do it just right?
	Before we answer this question, it is worth mentioning that picking a good research topic is important, but not as important as picking the right <a href="https://teddylazebnik.com/blog-post.html?post=36">advisor and instute</a>. 
	Thus, after you pick the best advisor and institute (in this order) for you; this is the time to pick the best research topic for your Ph.D.
</p>
<h3>Dive Deep into Your Interests</h3>
<p>
	What sparks your curiosity within your field? Is there a specific area you find endlessly fascinating?
	Start by brainstorming topics that genuinely excite you.
	They do not have to be fully formed ideas yet – just areas that ignite your intellectual fire.
</p>
<p>
	In biomathematics, for instance, your enthusiasm might lie in understanding complex biological systems. 
	Perhaps you are fascinated by the intricate dance of hormones in the endocrine system. 
	Maybe you are drawn to the mathematical modeling of population dynamics and ecological balance. 
	It could even be the spread of infectious diseases and the effectiveness of vaccination strategies that pique your interest.
	I would claim this is the wrong way to approach this. The above examples are <b> objectives </b> and <b>methods</b> and not questions. 
	Look around, what makes you angry for not understanding? What issue you would like to solve? 
	Going back to the biomathematics example - cancer is a complex biological system, maybe improving a treatment protocol for cancer?  
	This is the kind of questions you would like to answer for yourself. 
	 By pinpointing your initial area of fascination, you'll be setting yourself on a path of discovery that is both personally fulfilling and academically rewarding.
</p>
<h3>Become a Master of Literature Reviews</h3>
<p>
	Once you have a general area of interest, like the impact of social media on mental health, it is time to become a master of literature reviews. 
	This involves reading the existing research to truly understand the current state of knowledge and identify potential gaps in understanding. 
	 Look for classic texts or seminal studies that established the core concepts and theoretical frameworks in your field. These will provide a strong foundation for your research.
	 This first step is easier said than done. However, an easy hack is just to ask around - ask your lab members, your advisor, and your lecturers which papers are considered fundamental to your topic.
</p>
<p>
	Next, while staying focused on your area of interest, explore research papers that approach the topic from different angles or methodologies. This will expose you to diverse perspectives and potential connections to other fields.
	As you analyze the existing literature, critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of current research. Are there limitations in the methodologies used? Are there specific aspects of the topic that haven't been fully explored? By pinpointing these gaps, you can formulate your own unique research question that contributes fresh insights to the field.
	Overall, you wish to answer two questions: 1) what is the novelty of your research question? and 2) what is the impact of answering it? Make sure you have a good answer to <b>at least</b> one of these questions.
</p>
<h3>Consider Feasibility: Balancing Ambition with Resources</h3>
<p>
	Think about the practicalities of your research and how they align with your resources.
	This does not mean stifling your ambition, but rather ensuring your topic is achievable within the timeframe and constraints of a PhD program. 
	This point is hard to express currently and politely. So, let me be a "mathematician" here. Statistically speaking, you will not be the next Newton (it is OK, probably neither do I).
	Now, when we agree on this point, recall the main objective of your PhD journey - to get a ******* PhD! The second objective should be to do so on time. The third objective is to do it well.	
</p>
<p>
	Let me outline some common limitations you should consider. First and mostly broad - data availability. Does your research require access to specific datasets, archives, or specialized equipment? Evaluate the feasibility of obtaining these resources within your program's budget and timeline.
	Also common in some sciences - is methodological expertise. Consider the research methods your topic necessitates. Do you have the necessary skills and training to conduct the research effectively? If not, are there opportunities to acquire those skills during your PhD program?
	Finally, the one that people tend to underestimate - is timeline constraints. Be realistic about the time commitment required for your research. Does your topic require extensive fieldwork, time-consuming experiments, or complex data analysis? Ensure your research plan aligns with the expected timeframe for your PhD program.
</p>
<p>
	Remember, a feasible research topic doesn't have to be unoriginal.  There's often room to find a specific angle or niche within a broader field that is both intellectually stimulating and achievable within your program's resources.  Discuss potential challenges with your professors and advisors to brainstorm creative solutions and ensure your research is well-supported.
</p>
<h3> Find the Sweet Spot of Specificity: Balancing Focus with Exploration</h3>
<p>
	Your PhD research topic should not be too broad or too narrow. 
	Imagine a Goldilocks scenario – you want a topic that is just the right size to allow for focused investigation while still offering room for exploration and original contributions.
	A very broad topic can feel overwhelming and unmanageable. For example, researching "the impact of social media" is a vast undertaking. It would be difficult to delve deeply into any specific aspect within a PhD timeframe.
	On the other hand, a hyper-specific topic might limit your research potential. For instance, focusing solely on "the effect of a specific Instagram filter on teenage self-esteem" might not offer enough room for exploration and broader contributions to the field. (Editor comment - we apologize for the individual with this exact research topic, we are sure this is a lot of fun)
</p>
<p>
	The sweet spot lies in finding a topic that is specific enough to be manageable yet allows for focused research and original contributions.  
	Begin by brainstorming a general area of interest. Then, gradually narrow it down by considering specific research questions, methodologies, or populations you might focus on.
	In addition, discuss your evolving topic with professors and potential advisors. Their expertise can help you refine your focus while ensuring your research question remains relevant and impactful.
	Even with a specific topic, remember to connect it to broader questions within your field. How does your research contribute to existing knowledge? What are the potential implications of your findings?
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Finding the perfect PhD research topic is a crucial first step in your academic journey. 
This guide has equipped you with 4-step suggestions on how to do it right. To quickly summarize (as 90% of you just jump to this paragraph anyway [at least according to my website's heatmap]): First, ignite your passion by pinpointing a specific area within your field that sparks your curiosity.  
Next, read the existing research through a thorough literature review to understand the current landscape and identify potential gaps in knowledge.
Following that, ensure your topic aligns with your program's resources by considering data availability and methodological requirements. 
Finally, the ideal topic should be neither too broad nor too narrow – strive for a focused yet explorative research question.  
By following these steps, you will be well on your way to finding a research topic that fuels your passion and leads to a groundbreaking dissertation.
