From the beginning of mankind, we try to defeat death and make our lifestyle better by being healthy. This is a very understandable wish for anybody who was sick even once (For the readers who weren't ill even once in their life, please send me an email with your contact details - I would like to check this phenomena). The medicine discipline developed very much over the years, especially in the last 30 years. Therefore, I would like to present my thoughts about how medicine should be 30 years from now...
</p>
<h3>
Step 1 - nanorobotic capsules replace pills
</h3>
<p>
For a long time now, we use pills as the main medical treatment, which is not surgery, both inside and outside the white walls of the hospital. In general, the pills that we take contain an active ingredient which affects the bacteria or the virus that makes us sick and therefore cure us.
</p>
<p>
When I told this story to my little cousin (After Sesame Street was over of course) he had a wonderful question: "Why the pill does this? Can we tell the pill to fight only the bad bacteria?". Unfortunately, the answer was "No, we can't" (Not very Obama style) â€“ cause pills release their active ingredient as soon as they entered into the body immediately effect all over the place. Nevertheless, do not despair - we have a different option!
</p>
<p>
As described on <a href="/blog/blog-post-5.html" title="Medical nanorobotics - science or science fiction">"Medical nanorobotics - science or science fiction"</a> nanorobotics capsules are a very felicitous choice for drug delivery units. This capsules can be injected into the blood system and release the drug only in regains affected by the disease. These two new capabilities make nanorobotic capsules a very attractive candidate for replacing the familiar pills because it solves its main issue and not present other new issues yet. 
</p>
<h3>
Step 2 - nanorobotic capsules become personal
</h3>
<p>
Another trend that swept the world over is the personalization of services and products. This trend started with our electronic devices with we can choose the background photo of our phone, replace the calling music and etc. In the past few years, we even talked about making a costume study plan to each student in school.
</p>
<p>
I believe the natural following step in this welcome trend is to apply it to our medicine as well! By using diagnose tool that is more accurate than ever before, we are able to diagnose the most proper amount of a medicine to each patient (if our patient is very unlucky and sick a lot of times, then this statement refer to each illness separately)
</p>
<p>
But, one (for example you - my Sherlock Holms like readers) may claim that it is irrelevant if a patient needs 8.7mg of a cure when there are only 5mg pills in the market. One will be correct in his/her claim as there are not integer which multiplying by 5 gives 8.7 (Believe me, I tried them all for you) But as you may guess nanorobotics capsules can handle this problem very simply.
</p>
<p>
Each nanorobot contains very small amount of the cure and we can set as many nanorobots as we need in the capsule so even 8.7gm does not dream anymore.
</p>
<h3>
Step 3 - print nanorobotic capsules at home
</h3>
<p>
The last and most excitement (if you ask me) improvement we can add now - when we replace old fashion pills with the new nanorobotics capsules and even make thus capsules personal per patient; is to be able to print them in our home.
</p>
<p>
Today, with the improvement of 3D printers we already able to imagine the ability to print tools, cloth, and even homes in the near future. The ability to print our own medicine at home will give places that far from central cities and third world countries ability to produce medicine fast and at a time of need.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, throw nanorobotics technology we can take the modern medicine one step further and cure faster, better and much more people than ever in history. For making this vision come true we should start by developing nanorobotics technology and research the technical and principal aspects of this subject.
</p>
<p>
Please let me know if you have any proposals on how to make this vision a reality or thoughts/questions about medical nanorobotics in general for a better understanding of this phenomenal subject (For both of us). <br> <br>
