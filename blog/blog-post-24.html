As the USA president, Harry Truman met with many economists over the years [1]. 
Allegedly, at some point, Truman had enough and asked his office manager: "Give me a one-handed Economist! All my economists say 'on one hand...', then 'but on the other hand...'".
In this immortal quote Truman was able to comically describe one of the major difficulties in economics: 
the dissonance between social sciences which are mostly empirical-based with minor to no rigorousness theories and the exact science rooted in theories increasingly being built from simple rules.
As such, the economy like no other science has to bridge between complex equations and computational models and the massiness of working with systems involving people.

One direction economics took in the last few decades is behavioral economy [2] which was started by the work of Nobel laureate Richard Thaler [3]. Behavioral economics combines elements of economics and psychology to understand how and why people behave the way they do in the real world. It differs from neoclassical economics, which assumes that most people 
have well-defined preferences and make well-informed, self-interested decisions based on those preferences. 
In plain English, behavioral economics examines the differences between what people "should" do and what they actually do.

While this direction seems promising and indeed yields a few revolutionary results, it is not without flaws. 
For example, a detailed review of papers in behavioral economy from 2018 shows almost no mathematical models to explain economical processes or phenomena [4]. 
The field mostly leans on social experiments and phycological theories (which have received a lot of criticism over the years inability of the scientific community to reproduce results).
This means behavioral economics gives interesting and useful information but does not provide a comprehensive understanding of economic processes.
Therefore, it limits the ability to generalize known outcomes to new population groups and unfamiliar situations.

Another approach and the problems it has.

more review on the other approach.

However, not everything is lost and economists can bridge the inner gap between social and exact science using computer science [5].
It is common to see how computer science bridges several sciences with mathematical models through applied algorithms [6], computational models [7], and <i>in silico</i> experiments [8].
A few key examples are:
