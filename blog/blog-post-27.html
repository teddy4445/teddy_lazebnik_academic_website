<p>
	state how the math works nowadays and cite few papers as shown below
</p>
<p>
	For example, <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/ardeshir.bayat.html" alt=" Dr. Ardeshir Bayat - Principal Investigator and Reader (Tenured Associate Professor) based at the University of Manchester">Ardeshir Bayat</a> suggested in his paper from 2002 that "Large commercial enterprises such as pharmaceutical companies employ bioinformaticians to perform and maintain the large scale and complicated bioinformatics needs of these industries. With an ever-increasing need for constant input from bioinformatics experts, most biomedical laboratories may soon have their own in-house bioinformatician. The individual researcher, beyond a basic acquisition and analysis of simple data, would certainly need external bioinformatic advice for any complex analysis." [6].

	Summary 
</p>
<p>
	This review has carried on as part of the <i>Collective Evolution Learning Model for Vision-Based Collective Motion with Collision Avoidance</i> project where we aim to model a collective motion with collision avoidance in swarms using visin-based input.
