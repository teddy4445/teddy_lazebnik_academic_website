	Mathematical Models are known for decades to be a powerful tool to study, understand, and predict natural processes. 
	Moreover, as computational power becoming more accessible and affordable, mathematical models become more popular and useful over time.
	Indeed, one can find mathematical models to be in the heart of multiple products and ideas in our daily life without even noticing. 
	Do you need an example? When you waiting for the traffic lights it is the shortest time that promises optimal flow of movment in the road. 
	Maybe you are waiting for the end of the news to know the weather for tomorrow. This is just two examples from uncountable amount souranding us. 
</p>
<p>
	It is not a superise that mathemtics also entered the healthcare domain, one of the most important domains we have in our life according to the average persion on the street (Did not formally chcked, so just a guess for now).  
	Since healthcare and clinics are large fields of knowledge, it is hard and out of the scope of this text to pinpoint the contribution of the mathematical science in recent developments.
	Nonetheless, a large body of work focus on mathematical modeling of cancer development and treatment [1].
	It is fair to say that these models contributed to the development of drugs and improvment of treatment protocols. However, they are no without flaws.
	As such, in this blog-post I would like to present a quick overview of the promise and limitations of cell-cell mathematical models in cancer treatment.
</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
	As a tool to make sense of the interactions among the many components of the tumor microenvironment, researchers have used mathematical models since
	these models can investigate interactions on different biological scales and also investigate the emergent properties of the system.
	These mathematical models are used to distill the essential components of the interactions, 
	thus identifying the most plausible mechanisms that can lead to the observed outcomes, if done correctly. 
</p>
<p>
	To be exact, in recent years, evidence has accumulated indicating that the immune system can recognize and eliminate malignant tumors.
	This finding lead to the development of powerful cancer treatment called <i>immunotherapies</i>. 
	In order to use immunotherapies, one requires first an understanding of the mechanisms governing the dynamics of tumor growth and its interactions with the immune system.
</p>
<p>
	As such, early modeling attempts focused on the tumor growth dynamics while trying to understand how <i>normal</i> cells can mutate into cancer cells.
	More recently, biological come to the conclusion that oversimplified concept of a single type of normal cell is inadequate. 
	Hence, the models extended accordily to include interactions among multiple cell types and chemicals play fundamental roles in the initiation and progression of tumors.
	To accuratly represnent the bio-clinical dynamics, the tumor <i>microenvironment</i> included multiple cell types with unique rules and properties.
	For example, immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, signaling molecules, and tumor cells.
</p>
<p>
	Due to the large number of components, intreactions between them, and the over time changing dynamics,  
	understanding these interactions sufficiently to derive cancer immunotherapies, has proven a very challenging task [2].
	As a tool to tackle this challenge, researchers have used mathematical models, mainly based on the cell-cell interaction of cell population as function of their size.
	These model more often than not described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs for short).

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
	Cell-cell interaction models can fairly represent the biological and clinical processes in general and for oncological patients in particular.
	Current model starting to take into considuation the spatial effect of cells and organs but much more research should be conducted so we fully understand and be able to model these dynamics.

	With the ever-increasing access to high-performance computing and data alongside advances in theoretical understanding of biological and clinical processes throughout mathematical models, new open questions in theoretical and applied biologically have recently emerged in the scientific community. These include the ability to personalize a clinical treatment as well as predict treatment outcomes without the need to widely test it, etc.
	
	Mathematical modeling is shown to be a useful tool in oncology, allowing to investigate both the disease and possible treatments. A particular group of models that are able to obtain accurate predictions of biological and clinical outcomes is the ones based on cell-cell interactions. In parallel, in recent years, immunotherapy treatments showing promising results with fewer side effects, long-term effects, and better success rates for multiple diseases and cancer in particular. However, many opportunities in cell-cell interaction-based models for cancer immunotherapy treatment are still available, enriching both our understanding of biomathematical models, clinical processes, and the interactions between. Specificities underlying each particular setting usually trigger interesting disclosures concerning models and methods of resolution.
	
	The purpose of this Special Issue is to give a stage for modern applied mathematical models tackling immunotherapy treatments in multiple forms of cancer in order to straighten the connection between theoretical and applied biology and present novel ideas for clinical investigation. <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells/special_issues" alt="call for paper cell" title="call for paper cell">We invite authors to submit research articles that fit this purpose.</a>
