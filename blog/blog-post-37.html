<h3>Music Technology</h3>
<p>
	MIDI, which stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, is a technical standard established in the early 1980s to enable electronic musical instruments, computers, and other related devices to communicate and synchronize with each other. 
	The MIDI protocol defines a way to transmit information about musical notes, control signals, and other performance data digitally, without transmitting audio signals directly. 
	MIDI messages are composed of a series of bytes, starting with a status byte that indicates the type of message (e.g., note on, note off, control change) and the channel number (1-16). 
	Following the status byte are data bytes that provide additional information, such as the note number and velocity. 
	When a key is pressed on a MIDI controller, a "Note On" message is sent, including the note number and the velocity. 
	When the key is released, a "Note Off" message is sent. 
	Control Change messages allow for the control of various parameters such as volume, pan, modulation, and other effects, with each message including a controller number and a value. 
	MIDI supports 16 channels, allowing multiple instruments to be controlled independently, and includes timing and synchronization features to keep devices in sync. System Exclusive (SysEx) messages enable manufacturer-specific data transmission, allowing proprietary control over certain devices.
</p>
<p>
	MIDI was revolutionary because it provided a standardized protocol that was universally adopted, ensuring compatibility across a wide range of devices. 
	Before MIDI, electronic musical instruments and devices often used proprietary protocols, making it difficult to integrate equipment from different manufacturers. 
	MIDI's versatility extends beyond musical notes to include control data for various devices, from synthesizers and drum machines to lighting and stage effects. 
	It operates in real-time, crucial for live performances and studio work where timing and responsiveness are essential. 
	The protocol is efficient, requiring only a few bytes per message, enabling reliable data transmission even over long distances or wireless connections. 
	Additionally, MIDI's design allows for expandability, with new messages and features added without breaking compatibility with existing devices. This standard facilitated the integration of computers into music production, enabling software sequencers, virtual instruments, and DAWs to control and manipulate music in previously impossible ways, revolutionizing music composition and production.	
</p>
<p>
	The next huge step in music technology is Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). 
	DAWs are software platforms used for recording, editing, mixing, and producing audio files. 
	DAWs integrate various tools and functionalities that allow musicians, producers, and sound engineers to create professional-grade music and audio projects.

	DAWs support multi-track recording, which enables users to record and layer multiple audio sources simultaneously. 
	They also offer non-destructive editing, allowing users to modify and experiment with audio without permanently altering the original recordings. 
	Common features of DAWs include MIDI sequencing, which allows for the integration of MIDI instruments and controllers, and virtual instruments, which emulate the sounds of traditional instruments through software.
</p>
<p>
	DAWs were revolutionary because they transformed the music production process, making high-quality audio production accessible to a broader range of users. 
	Before DAWs, music production required expensive and complex hardware setups, including mixing consoles, tape machines, and outboard effects processors. 
	DAWs consolidated these functionalities into a single software environment, significantly reducing costs and complexity. 
	This democratization of music production empowered independent musicians and producers to create professional-quality music without the need for a traditional recording studio. 
	DAWs also introduced new possibilities for creative experimentation, with powerful editing tools, <b>virtual instruments</b>, and extensive libraries of sounds and effects. 
	The ability to automate various parameters, such as volume and effects, further enhanced the precision and flexibility of music production. 
	Overall, DAWs have revolutionized the way music is made, allowing for greater creativity, accessibility, and efficiency in the music production process.
</p>
<p>
	In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the development of virtual instruments and software synthesis expanded the capabilities of DAWs significantly. 
	Virtual instruments, also known as software synthesizers or virtual synths, revolutionized music production by emulating the sounds of traditional instruments and hardware synthesizers through software algorithms. 
	These tools provided musicians and producers with a vast palette of sounds and textures that could be manipulated and customized with unprecedented ease and flexibility.
		Virtual instruments allowed for the recreation of classic analog synthesizers, acoustic instruments, and entirely new sounds that were impossible to achieve with physical instruments alone. 
	They offered advanced features such as multiple oscillators, filters, envelopes, and effects that could be adjusted and automated within the DAW environment. 
	This versatility not only enhanced creative possibilities but also streamlined the production process by eliminating the need for physical hardware and extensive setup times.
</p>
<p>
	Software synthesis further democratized access to sound design and music production tools, making professional-grade instruments and effects accessible to musicians of all levels. 
	Whether recreating the warmth of vintage analog gear or exploring cutting-edge digital textures, virtual instruments became integral to modern music production workflows. 
	Their integration within DAWs provided seamless compatibility and synchronization, allowing for intricate layering, arrangement, and manipulation of audio within a unified software environment.
</p>
<p>
	Starting in the late 1990s and gaining momentum into the early 2000s, the advent of digital audio formats and online distribution channels marked a transformative shift in how music was consumed, distributed, and monetized. Digital audio formats, such as MP3, AAC, and WAV, revolutionized music storage and playback by compressing audio files into smaller sizes without significant loss in quality. This compression enabled faster downloads and easier sharing over the internet, overcoming the limitations of physical media like CDs and vinyl records.
	Online distribution platforms played a pivotal role in democratizing access to music, allowing artists to reach global audiences without the need for traditional record labels or physical distribution networks. Platforms like iTunes, launched in 2001, and later streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music, provided listeners with instant access to a vast catalog of music from anywhere with an internet connection.
	The shift towards digital formats and online distribution empowered independent musicians and small labels to distribute their music globally, leveling the playing field in the music industry. Artists could release music directly to their fans, bypassing traditional gatekeepers and retaining greater control over their creative output and revenue streams.

<h3>The New Frontier</h3>
<p>
	In this section, we explore three transformative tasks that AI performs in the realm of music. First, AI’s capability in music composition allows it to autonomously generate original pieces by analyzing vast datasets of existing music, creating melodies, harmonies, and arrangements that span various genres and styles. Second, AI significantly advances music production and mixing by automating complex tasks such as sound engineering, mastering, and mixing, optimizing audio quality and enhancing the creative process with tools that adjust levels and apply effects based on user preferences. Lastly, AI excels in music recommendation and personalization, utilizing machine learning to analyze listener habits and preferences, providing highly tailored music suggestions that enhance the discovery experience and keep users engaged with new and relevant content.
</p>
<p>
	Music composition using AI represents a frontier where advanced machine learning algorithms, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), are employed to autonomously generate intricate musical compositions. At its core, AI-driven music composition begins with the encoding of musical data into numerical representations, often using formats like MIDI or symbolic note sequences. These representations serve as inputs for training deep learning models that learn patterns, structures, and stylistic elements from extensive datasets of musical scores or recordings.
</p>
<p>
	During the training phase, AI models iteratively adjust their parameters to minimize prediction errors and maximize the likelihood of generating coherent musical sequences. Techniques such as autoregressive modeling enable the generation of music by predicting subsequent notes based on previous sequences, while sampling from learned probability distributions allows for the creation of entirely new musical passages. Moreover, AI excels in style transfer and hybridization, where it can emulate and combine diverse musical genres or artist styles to produce innovative compositions that blend familiarity with novelty. Evaluating the output involves metrics for musicality, coherence, and stylistic fidelity, guiding iterative refinements in the model to enhance the quality and creativity of generated compositions.
</p>
<p>
	Music production and mixing using AI integrates advanced machine learning techniques to transform the process of creating and refining musical tracks. Utilizing deep learning models trained on extensive audio datasets, AI algorithms automate complex tasks such as sound engineering, mastering, and real-time adaptive mixing. These algorithms analyze audio signals to adjust levels, apply effects, and enhance sound quality, optimizing the production workflow and allowing producers to focus more on creative decisions. AI-powered mastering tools ensure consistency in volume levels and dynamic range across tracks, while quality assurance algorithms detect and correct imperfections like noise or distortion. This integration not only enhances efficiency but also facilitates rapid experimentation with sound design and audio effects, pushing the boundaries of creativity in music production and engineering. As AI technologies continue to evolve, ongoing research aims to refine these algorithms for even more sophisticated audio processing capabilities, shaping the future of how music is produced and mixed.
</p>
<p>
	Music recommendation and personalization powered by AI relies on sophisticated machine learning models such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation systems. Collaborative filtering techniques include user-based and item-based approaches, where similarities between users or music items are computed based on historical interaction data. Models like Matrix Factorization and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are commonly used in collaborative filtering to predict user preferences and recommend music based on similar user behaviors. Content-based filtering, on the other hand, utilizes attributes of songs such as genre, tempo, and acoustic features to recommend music that matches a user's preferences. Natural Language Processing (NLP) models may be employed to analyze song metadata and user-generated content for enhanced recommendations. Hybrid recommendation systems integrate both collaborative and content-based approaches, leveraging their respective strengths to provide more accurate and diverse music suggestions. These AI-driven systems continuously update user profiles using techniques like deep learning and reinforcement learning to adapt to evolving user preferences and contextual factors such as time of day and location, ensuring personalized and engaging music discovery experiences in digital music platforms.

<h3>What is going on today?</h3>
<p>
	What can be more intresting than the current state of the art? Nowadays, there is a tend to the "prompt to X" where users write a query in natural text and obtained some output X.
	This is part of the GenAI (generative AI) revolution we expriance since OpenAI's ChatGPT released in 2022. 
	AI music generation models function by leveraging machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques, to analyze vast amounts of music data and translate that knowledge into creating new musical pieces. 
	First, data preparation and processing. The first step involves collecting a large and diverse dataset of music. This data can come from various sources like MIDI files, music recordings in different genres, or even sheet music.
	The raw music data needs to be converted into a format understandable by the machine learning model. This can involve techniques like converting note sequences into numerical representations or using more complex methods to capture musical characteristics like pitch, rhythm, and timbre.
	Second, a chosen model (sorry, not spesifics at this point) is trained on the prepared music data. During training, the model analyzes patterns, structures, and stylistic elements within the data. It essentially learns the relationships between musical elements and how they typically come together in different genres and styles.
</p>
<p>
	Now, we can actually generate music! Once trained, the model can generate music through various prompts or starting points. This could be a simple melody, a specific genre, or even just a description of the desired mood.
	The model uses its knowledge of musical patterns to predict the next element in a musical sequence. It considers the information provided in the prompt and the music it has already "seen" during training. Techniques like autoregressive models predict the next note based on previous ones, while sampling from learned probabilities allows for creating entirely new passages
	The model iteratively predicts the next element in the sequence, building the music piece one step at a time. This can involve generating melodies, harmonies, rhythms, and even selecting appropriate instruments based on the learned styles.
	In some cases, the generated music may be evaluated using metrics like coherence, musicality, and adherence to the prompt's style. Based on this evaluation, the model might be fine-tuned to improve the quality of future generations.
	These capabilities are already avalible by companies like <a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a> and <a href="https://www.udio.com/">Udio</a>, allowing unprofessionals to create music quicker and easier than ever before.
</p>
<p>
	Interestingly enough, when taking the "prompt to X" state of mind for professionals, everything becomes somewhat harder. These users do not want to have <b>any</b> music in 30 seconds; they are willing to spend time and energy but they want <b>spesific</b> music with their wishes and constrains.
	To this void, <a href="https://aiode.com/">Aiode</a> uses a unique combination of fundemental LLM models for the query to their own music-encoding space followed by a transfer model to generate short-span music based on real-world musicans!
	Their approach is technologically unqiue in the sense that the model does not try to generate music but rather the set of actions a musician would take to generate this music.  
</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
	In conclusion, the evolution of music technology, from the advent of MIDI and DAWs to the current era of AI-driven innovations, has profoundly reshaped the landscape of music creation, production, and consumption.
