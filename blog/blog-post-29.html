	As a graduate student and researcher in academia, I have encountered my fair share of conflicts.
	From disagreements over authorship on publications to clashes over project timelines, conflicts can arise from various sources in academic settings. 
	Through my experiences, I have learned several lessons on how to manage conflicts effectively. 
	In this blog post, I will share some of these insights and offer practical strategies for managing conflicts in academic settings.
</p>
<h4>Communication is key</h4>
<p>
	One of the most important lessons I have learned is the significance of communication. 
	Many conflicts in academia arise from miscommunications or misunderstandings. 
	It is essential to communicate clearly and often with all team members to ensure everyone is on the same page. 
	Regular check-ins and updates can prevent conflicts from escalating and enable prompt resolution of any issues that do arise.

	I guess that most readers will roll their eyes, reflecting on the cliche related to this suggestion.
	To be honest, they are right to do so... Thus, let me be a bit more specific. 
	Tell the truth, tell your feelings, and tell everything as soon as you can. 
	In the short-term, this is a bad strategy as others would really enjoy exploiting it, especially in a super-competitive environment such as academia.
	Nonetheless, the ones that would keep this line of action long enough, will benefit from decent partners, easy-to-manage working relationships, and even shorter hours in the office.
	For all the readers sure they are smart enough to lie their way around the academic conflicts and cheap politics, you are probably right.
	That said, you can lie to all people sometimes, and to some people all the time but not both. Just one F**k in the credibility is enough to end your game. 
	As such, for the long-term, being brutally honest (but polite) is my go-to strategy and the one I can recommend.

<h4>Power dynamics matter</h4>
<p>
Power dynamics can also play a significant role in conflicts in academia. 
In research teams, senior members may hold more power and influence over project decisions, leading to conflicts with junior members. 
Recognizing these dynamics and ensuring all team members have a voice and feel heard can help to mitigate conflicts.
</p>
<p>
I had a conflict with my Ph.D. advisor. As usually happens, it is not really important which side was right - the advisor has most (or even all) the power as the student is usually strongly dependent.
Unfortunately, I yet was able to put my finger on a good strategy to tackle this issue. Hence, the best suggestion is to avoid such advisors. Speak with current and previous students to learn as much as you can.
If possible, agree on as many details about the program as you can before the beginning of the project. This is also true for more "important" peers. If possible, just avoid them as much as you can. 
If you can not, getting to the working table knowing you already lost helps to control the negative atmosphere commonly surrounding these interactions when they go bad.
</p>
<h4>Understand differences in objectives </h4>
<p>
Understanding the differences in objectives of the team members is a crucial factor in managing conflicts in academic settings. 
Each individual in a research team may have their own objectives, priorities, and expectations regarding a project. 
These differences can lead to conflicts, especially when these objectives are not aligned. 
One strategy for understanding differences in objectives is just to ask. Really, as simple as it sounds.
Understanding the academic game and even a half-honest answer can help you to know the main objective of each team member in the project.
Once you are more or less familiar with the objectives of the team, finding a shared goal can reduce the number of conflicts. 
Moreover, use the objective of individuals as constraints to others to move forward the overall team's objective.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, conflicts are an inevitable part of academic settings, but they can be managed effectively with the right approach. 
By prioritizing communication, understanding power dynamics, and understanding differences in the team members' objectives, conflicts can be resolved more effectively, 
enabling research teams to work productively and collaboratively toward their shared goals.

<h4>Acknowledgement</h4>
<p>
	At this point, I wish to thank all my academic collaborators. Some of them became my friends, others individuals in my block list on my phone, or left just as collaborators.
	However, in all cases, they teach me and make me the researcher and academic I am today.
