First, we need to import a few libraries so it will be easy to work. One can avoid the <b>numpy</b> and <b>pandas</b> libraries but this will require to re-write a lot of ready, easy to use code so you probably do not need to do so without a really good reason.
<pre class="language-python">
<code class="language-python">
import numpy as np  # for numerical manipulations
import pandas as pd # for data manipulations
import matplotlib as mpl # for graphs generations... the main library we discuss today
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # just the plot manager of this library
import seaborn as sns # an extension of the matplotlib library that will save us a lot of time
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Model performance with noisy data</h3>
<p>
The wolrd is messy, and your data is messy is well. But, there is no need to be ashamed of this - on the opposite, give it the place it deserve and plot it!
A lot reports, papers and etc. show only the average (mean) result of a research. Do not get me wrong, the average result holds meaningful information but as my Ph.D. advioser once said as a paraphrase on the common phrase <i>"god is in the standard deviation"</i>.
Therefore, here are a few graphs showing both the average result and the error around it.
</p>

<h4>Scatter plot with linear regression line of best fit</h4>
<p>
<pre class="language-python">
<code class="language-python">
# Import Data
df = pd.read_csv("your-csv-here")

# Plot
sns.set_style("white") # I like it, pick the one looks best on your report
gridobj = sns.lmplot(
					 x="df-col-name", # the depndent parameter
					 y="df-col-name", # the indepndent parameter
					 hue="df-col-name", # the coloum that defined two or more groups (not commanly used)
					 data=df, # the data frame one wants to plot
					)

# Decorations
gridobj.set(xlim=(min-value, max-value), 
            ylim=(min-value, max-value))
plt.title("An informative title for your plot")

# Save and close for next plot
plt.save_fig(the-path-you-need-here)
plt.close()
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Time series</h3>
<p>
Time goes by and generating a very important dimention to your data while doing so. People just love seeing how things change over time. 
If you have a time series data, the following graphs just give your audience excatlly what they are looking for...

<h4>Slope Chart</h4>

This discussion haviliy based on the <b>Mathplotlib</b> library as it really common and operates as the base of other more advanced libraries. 
Understanding Mathplotlib and beening able to manipulate the graphs in this level easly transform to same skill on "higher" level libraries. 
Hover, we could not end this dicussion without several honorable mentions one needs to check to reduce development time:

	<li><a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/">Folium</a> - makes it easy to visualize data on an interactive leaflet map. The library has a number of built-in tilesets from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> (that I personally like), and <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/">Stamen</a>.</li>

Congracolations! you are now the master of AI plots. You just need to do all the other parts of a secsessful AI project and plot your way to the victory. 
Comunincating your results (even if they not as good as you hoped) in the right way is a crutial part of developing new technology and products. 
By the way, if you would like some help with the ploting for your AI, or any other part in this manner, feel free to <a href="/about.html">contact me</a>.
