<h4>About The Lab</h4>
<p>
	The lab is focusing on the mathematical modeling of personalized medicine in the widest sense. 
	The idea is to use mathematical and computational methods (simulations, machine learning, differential equations, stochastic processes) to solve problems related to personalized medicine.
	Personalized medicine goes from the treatment of a single patient to the distribution of resources to manage a pandemic in a population.
	That said, I am open to new and cool ideas - check out my previous papers and current projects for more context.
</p>

<h4>Why choosing our lab</h4>
<p>
	It is always a challenge to be honest and to "sell" an idea. Therefore, I will try to be number-driven in this section... <br>
	First, fully-remote. You will have to come for courses and other stuff, but if you ask me, you can do your research wherever you want.
	We can meet online and discuss stuff over the phone and via email. If you want the 3D experience as well, it also works and we can meet - it is your choice. <br>
	Second, we have funding! The first 3 Ph.D. students (1 left as of 23.6.2024) who want to have a full-time Ph.D., will have relatively good funding. We also looking for a post-doc for a year (fully-funded) - true for 23.6.2024. <br>
	Third, we have very cool clinical data from close academic relationships with Israeli and international hospitals - if you wish to work on unique data, this is the right place. <br>
	Finally, we have brand new GPU (+ CPU) servers. This means we can run (very) large models and simulations. If this makes you excited, you are in the right place.	
</p>

<h4>What we are looking for</h4>
<p>
	We are looking for students with previous academic experience, probably with a paper in Q1\Q2 journal from the last two years. 
	In addition, a strong background in programming (preferably Python + JS), machine learning, and mathematical modeling.
	If you wish to be funded, a full-time is required. If you do not, a full day a week is fine.
</p>
<p>
	It is important to note, that the standard in the lab is super high. 
	We are here to make high-impact and timely research... If you wish to publish and publish in good journals, this is the right place. If you want to "take it easy", we are not the right lab for you.
</p>

<h4>How to apply</h4>
<p>
	I strongly suggest you review the <a href="research.html?&section=Work-with-me" alt="work with me page on this website">work with me</a> page on this website.
	In short, send me an email with why you wish to join and a bit about yourself. It can be a CV, it can just be an email and we will take it there.
