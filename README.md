# Teddy Lazebnik's Website (and Andorid app)

This is my academic website (and app). 
The project is not organize too well and the documentation is fine (but it can be better). 
The idea is to host a website in GitHub-pages so it cannot have back-end on one hand but we still want to do cool things on the other hand.
Therefore, you will find a use of different JS libraries (no frameworks as compiling is not supported) to do cool things and some of my code.

Please feel free to clone the project, update the content according to your needs and have your own academic website :)
I am adding new features and cool things on my free time just for myself, friends, сolleagues, and students - but if you have some spesific request I would glad to talk about it.

Recently, I started working on mobile app for the website (just to learn Kotlin & Swift) and the results are not bad as one might think, you can check them out:
