			"description": "In recent years there has been a major breakthrough in the field of artificial neural networks, especially in deep neural networks (namely, networks with many layers). Deep learning is the term coined for the training of such networks, which have shown superiority over other machine learning algorithms in many applications. Nowadays, deep neural networks provide the best performance in tasks such as, voice recognition, object detection, image classification and content suggestion. These networks gradually take over standard machine learning algorithms and we are at the heart of a new generation, where voice recognition and image recognition are based on them fully. In this course we will explain the mathematics at the core of neural networks models, and provide practical tools for using them. The course focuses mainly on image processing and, consequently, on convolutional neural networks."
