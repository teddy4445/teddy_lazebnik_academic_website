	"work_with_me_opening": "<h2>For Colleagues</h2> <h3>What I bring to the table</h3> More often than not, I am usually the technical guy in the project, responsible for the data analysis, model development, and producing super cool graphs and tables. It is worth mentioning that I am an OK-ish writer but always happy to write the technical section of the paper. If I may, my main selling point in the academic realm is the time to deliver as I am aiming to keep a very fast-paced project delivery while ensuring the highest level of quality. <br><br>  <h3>What I am looking for in an academic project</h3> I believe that researchers should agree in advance about how a project is managed and operated. Hence, my usual main points of concern: <br>1) Time to deliver - once we agree on a time to deliver something, by anyone on the team, it should be ready on time or everyone should get an update as soon as possible about the drift from plans. If you delay time and time again, I will take my stuff and leave. <br> 2) Credit distribution - we will agree on the author list in advance and set up a metric to re-visit the order at the end, making sure everyone gets his real credit and not playing games or performing political tricks. <br> 3) Paper submission payments (i.e., APC) - If I have money, I will gladly pay. However, we need to agree on the budget limit for each paper in advance. <br> 4) Working with your students - I enjoy the company of students like the other guy. Nonetheless, if you work with me, I expect to work with you - not your (amazing) student(s). It is wonderful if your students participate in the project but this does not mean you can disappear for weeks each time or not take personal responsibility on the project. This means that if the student does not deliver, I am expecting you to handle and fix this. <br> 5) Submission blocking - I know this is an unpleasant topic, but let's quickly discuss it... If I have done a lot of work to produce a paper and someone is blocking the submission due to any reason, I am leaving the decision to the leading PI - which we will agree on at the beginning of the project. All team members will agree in advance who is the leading PI before the project starts. In the moment of truth, if a team member refuses to accept the leading PI's decision, I promise to provide an unproportional response.<br> 6) Honesty - research is very dynamic and shit happens. We all should talk about stuff and overcome them. Hence, I do not check the results of my colleagues (or their students) but I expect them to be 100 percent sure about the credibility and honesty of the results they report. <br><br> On the happy side, I am looking for high-impact studies that have real-world implications, if possible. <br><br> <h3>How shall we start?</h3> Just send over an email - I promise to answer as soon as possible. It would be great if you could outline the main points of the research and pinpoint your needs. If you have difficulties doing so, no worries - we can discuss it together and come up with something together. <br><br> <h2>For Students</h2> <h3>Purpose</h3> It is important to make an informed decision when choosing a research mentor. This webpage will help you to understand how I (currently) view my role as a mentor as well as the expectations that I have for members of our team. This webpage is under constant review and revision, as it should be since it is a constant work in progress. Moreover, these guidelines are a bit generic as each person’s mentorship and training needs are unique.  <br><br>  <h3>Open research questions</h3> 1) Socio-economic tasks - solving analytically, numerically, or using simulation on a wide range of social, government, and economic tasks. <br>  2) Developing data-driven personalized clinical treatment protocols. In particular, I prefer cancer and autoimmune diseases (such as diabetes). <br>  3) Epidemiological dynamics modeling, forecasting, and understanding. In particular, in integration with other disciplines such as economy, governance, business management, biology, clinical, etc. <br> 4) I am a big fan of anything cool that you can simulate and use AI for decision-making, so you can be creative. <br> *) I really enjoy novel ideas from students, so please read my latest work and come up with your ideas! <br><br> <h3>Your mentorship network</h3> It is important to recognize that I am not an expert in all areas in which you wish to receive mentorship. However, I do consider it my responsibility to ensure that when I cannot meet your needs in a specific area we work together to connect you with a mentor that can. I encourage you to seek out their expertise and advice. You should not view me as the person central to your mentoring network since <b>you are the central person in your mentoring network</b>. Cultivating a thriving mentoring network is an important part of your research training and I will work to help you get started and identify your specific needs and how those needs can be met. <br><br>  <h3>My mentorship commitment to you when you join the team</h3> 1) At the bare minimum, we will have a weekly 1:1 meeting. I will do my best to never cancel this meeting if not absolutely necessary. If that happens, the meeting will be rescheduled for as soon as possible. You can cancel this meeting whenever you like. It is your time. <br><br>2) Our 1:1 agenda by default will include discussions about your wellness, readiness, obstacles, recognition, and feedback from me. However, you should be added to the meeting invite for any agenda you would like to have. This is important so we remember important topics, but you are free to use the time for whatever is on your mind. <br><br>3) When I schedule a meeting with you, I will always tell you what the meeting will be about when it is scheduled. <br><br>4) News or announcements that significantly impact you or your work will always come from me directly in a 1:1 meeting. I will hold dear your privacy. <br><br> 5) You will always get feedback from me when it is fresh. You will never get feedback from me when we discuss your overall performance that will be a surprise. We will always try to talk about small issues that come up so they do not turn into big issues. <br><br> 6) I trust you to manage your own time. You don’t need to clear with me in advance your time. You do not need to ask my permission to attend important appointments during business hours. <br><br> 7) Your work gets done your way. My focus is on outcomes, not output. Once we are clear on where we need to go, how you get there is up to you, with support from me and your committee as required. <br><br>8) A team is strongest when it is working together, looking after each other, and taking care of one another. Please look to your left and to your right for opportunities to help other members of our team. Please ask for help when you need it. Nobody works alone. <br><br> 9) I trust you to skip over me and talk to other colleagues (like your committee members/mentors) about anything you feel is relevant. You do not need to clear it with me in advance. <br><br> 10) I will attribute credit appropriately to you. I will never exaggerate my own role or minimize your contribution. I will be especially certain to nail down attribution when people want to hear about our accomplishments. <br><br>  <h3>Publishing</h3> In general, if a paper is written regarding a part of your research project and you conducted the research and prepared the manuscript you will be named as the first author. This policy is the same for all trainees. If other members of the team were involved in the work, they would also be listed as authors based on their contributions or alphabetically if their contributions were equal. No manuscripts will be submitted to any journal, conference, etc. without the prior review and consent of all co-authors (this includes student co-authors). <br><br>  <h3>Conflict resolution</h3> I expect that if you are having a problem with someone else on the team you will begin by approaching that person to discuss the problem openly. If the problem is not resolved to your satisfaction, then you are free to speak to me about the problem and I can help to mediate a remedy. If your problem is with me, please schedule an appointment so that we can discuss your concerns and try to remedy the problem. If you keep the problem to yourself there is no way for me to know that you are unhappy with the way things are going and, in my experience, most problems are easily remedied with an open discussion. <br><br><br> <h3>Team members</h3> The best way to know if you want to work with me is to ask individuals that already made this decision. You can (and should) approach them directly so they can tell you the truth with all the pros and cons. I suggest mixing current and alumni to get the bigger picture. You can checkout the <a href='lab.html' alt='Lab members page on this website'>Lab page</a> on this site for more infomation. <br><br> <h3>How to join</h3> Joining the lab is a two-phase processes. First, you need to make sure you can take me as an academic advisor in the first place. Please talk with the relevant personnel in the university to make sure this is indeed the case. I will not do it for you. Second, send over an email with a short introduction about yourself, your research desires, and why you think I am the best advisor for the task (not the other way around). I promise to answer as soon as possible. If I do not, please follow this algorithm: If less than 5 business days have passed - wait. If more than 5 business days and this is the first time, write another polite email. If 5 business days have passed from your second email, CC the head of the department and use a sad smiley in the title of the email. If I still do not answer after 5 more business days, I am probably dead and you are expected to find out where is my office and bring flowers. <br><br><br> I would like to thank <a href='http://www.mathepilab.org/opportunities'>Dr. Amy Greer</a> for the idea for this page.

			"description": "Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a complex psychopathology associated with intense emotional instability and high service utilization rates. While certain socio-demographic factors have been linked to an increased risk of BPD, their relation to hospitalization duration remains unclear. This retrospective study analyzed 1077 hospitalization records of 200 BPD-diagnosed patients. Patients' key socio-demographic characteristics were examined as to their potential relationship with the patients' hospitalization duration.  Patients' gender, age, education level, employment and marital statuses, and living arrangement were statistically significantly linked with patients' hospitalization duration. Additionally, the hospitalization index and previous hospitalization duration were also statistically associated with patients' hospitalization duration. Patients' expected hospitalization duration at admission varies significantly based, in part, on their socio-demographics. In order to prevent potentially unnecessary prolonged and regressive hospitalizations, an estimation of the expected hospitalization duration should be explicitly considered.",

			"description": "Online academic profiles are used by scholars to reflect a desired image to their online audience. In Google Scholar,  scholars can select a subset of co-authors for presentation in a central location on their profile using a social feature called the Co-authroship panel. In this work, we examine whether scientometrics and reciprocality can explain the observed selections. To this end, we scrape and thoroughly analyze a novel set of 120,000 Google Scholar profiles, ranging across four disciplines and various academic institutions. Our results suggest that scholars tend to favor co-authors with higher scientometrics over others for inclusion in their co-authorship panels. Interestingly, as one’s own scientometrics are higher, the tendency to include co-authors with high scientometrics is diminishing. Furthermore, we find that reciprocality is central in explaining scholars' selections.",

We collected data from 486 families which included a family tree graph and family members' satisfaction with each other. We obtain a model that is able to explain 75% of the family members' satisfaction with one another. We found three indicators for more satisfied families. First, larger families, on average, have more satisfied members. Moreover, families with kids from the same parents - i.e., without step-siblings also express more satisfaction from both their siblings and parents when the children are already adults. Lastly, the average satisfaction of the family's oldest alive generation has a positive linear and non-linear correlation with the satisfaction of the entire extended family.",

Although the Nash equilibrium outcome is conceptually appealing, it is not Pareto efficient. Nonetheless, while the Lindahl allocation is Pareto efficient, it does not Pareto dominate the Nash allocation. Scholars have proposed Pareto efficient allocations that are preferable to the Nash equilibrium bundle while exploiting the Pareto efficient properties of the Lindahl equilibrium. However, these models are always restricted. In this paper, we consider an extension of one of these models - the Trading model - to a finite number of private and public goods with asymmetric agents and prove the existence and uniqueness of a Pareto efficient Trading allocation based on personalized Lindahl prices, which Pareto dominates the unique Nash allocation in the economy.

In this paper, we utilize an adaptive version of Benford's law, a statistical phenomenon that describes the distribution of leading digits in naturally occurring datasets, to identify potential manipulation of results in research manuscripts, solely using the aggregated data presented in those manuscripts. Our methodology applies the principles of Benford's law to commonly employed analyses in academic manuscripts, thus, reducing the need for the raw data itself. To validate our approach, we employed 100 open-source datasets and successfully predicted 79% of them accurately using our rules. Additionally, we analyzed 100 manuscripts published in the last two years across ten prominent economic journals, with ten manuscripts randomly sampled from each journal. Our analysis predicted a 3% occurrence of result manipulation with a 96% confidence level. Our findings uncover disturbing inconsistencies in recent studies and offer a semi-automatic method for their detection.",

			"description": "Zoonotic disease transmission between animals and humans is a growing risk and the agricultural context as a likely point of transition. Understanding the dynamics of disease spread within wildlife, that may connect spatially isolated farms, and livestock that are often at high local densities facilitating spread within a farm is crucial for mitigating these risks. Specifically, the interactions between pigeons and cows clustered in dairy farms can lead to significant disease transmission, economic losses for farmers, and food shortages affecting animal, livestock, and human populations. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal multi-pathogen model based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) framework with continuous spatial movement. Our model accounts for both within-species and cross-species transmission of pathogens, as well as the exploratory-expository movement dynamics of pigeons, which play a critical role in the spread of infections. We implemented the proposed model as a computer program using the agent-based simulation approach. We explore different biologically-realistic scenarios using biologically-relevant setups, evaluating the effect of various parameters on the epidemic spread. Namely, we show that the heterogeneity of the pigeons' movement dynamics has only a relatively minor effect on the disease spread. In addition, pigeons' reduced movement behavior due to being infected with pathogens shows to have a positive linear correlation to the average reproduction number of the disease. ",

It is therefore paramount to have a robust and acceptable system in place that ensures fairness and due process for disputes. The current system largely relies on the integrity of researchers but often fails when disputes arise. The use of an unbiased, data-driven model could overcome this limitation. In this study, we developed the first game-theory-inspired model to explore the dynamics of co-authorship disputes. The results are alarming and suggest that the current academic practices are not fit for purpose. Worryingly, our model shows that the number of potential disputes increases as the number of authors participating in the research increases, which is the global trend.",
