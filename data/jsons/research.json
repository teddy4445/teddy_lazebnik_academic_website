	"work_with_me_opening": "<h3>Open research questions</h3> 1) Epidemiological dynamics modeling, forecasting, and understanding. In particular, in integration with other disciplines such as economy, governance, business management, biology, clinical, etc. <br> 2) Socio-economic tasks - solving analytically, numerically, or using simulation a wide range of social, government, and economic tasks. <br> 3) Developing data-driven personalized clinical treatment protocols. In particular, I prefer cancer and autoimmune diseases (such as diabetes). <br> 4) I am a big fan of anything cool that you can simulate and use AI for decision-making, so you can be creative. <br><br><h3>Purpose</h3> It is important to make an informed decision when choosing a research mentor. This document will help you to understand how I view my role as a mentor as well as the expectations that I have for members of our team. This document is under constant review and revision, as it should be since it is a constant work in progress. Moreover, these guidelines are a bit generic as each person’s mentorship and training needs are unique.  <br><br> <h3>Your mentorship network</h3> It is important to recognize that I am not an expert in all areas in which you wish to receive mentorship. However, I do consider it my responsibility to ensure that when I cannot meet your needs in a specific area we work together to connect you with a mentor that can. I encourage you to seek out their expertise and advice. You should not view me as the person central to your mentoring network since <b>you are the central person in your mentoring network</b>. Cultivating a thriving mentoring network is an important part of your research training and I will work to help you get started and identify your specific needs and how those needs can be met. <br><br> <h3>My mentorship commitment to you when you join the team</h3> 1) At the bare minimum, we will have a weekly 1:1 meeting. I will do my best to never cancel this meeting if not absolutely necessary. If that happens, the meeting will be rescheduled for as soon as possible. You can cancel this meeting whenever you like. It is your time. <br><br>2) Our 1:1 agenda by default will include discussions about your wellness, readiness, obstacles, recognition, and feedback from me. However, you should be added to the meeting invite for any agenda you would like to have. This is important so we remember important topics, but you are free to use the time for whatever is on your mind. <br><br>3) When I schedule a meeting with you, I will always tell you what the meeting will be about when it is scheduled. <br><br>4) News or announcements that significantly impact you or your work will always come from me directly in a 1:1 meeting. I will hold dear your privacy. <br><br> 5) You will always get feedback from me when it is fresh. You will never get feedback from me when we discuss your overall performance that will be a surprise. We will always try to talk about small issues that come up so they do not turn into big issues. <br><br> 6) I trust you to manage your own time. You don’t need to clear with me in advance your time. You do not need to ask my permission to attend important appointments during business hours. <br><br> 7) Your work gets done your way. My focus is on outcomes, not output. Once we are clear on where we need to go, how you get there is up to you, with support from me and your committee as required. <br><br>8) A team is strongest when it is working together, looking after each other, and taking care of one another. Please look to your left and to your right for opportunities to help other members of our team. Please ask for help when you need it. Nobody works alone. <br><br> 9) I trust you to skip over me and talk to other colleagues (like your committee members/mentors) about anything you feel is relevant. You do not need to clear it with me in advance. <br><br> 10) I will attribute credit appropriately to you. I will never exaggerate my own role or minimize your contribution. I will be especially certain to nail down attribution when people want to hear about our accomplishments. <br><br> <h3>Publishing</h3> In general, if a paper is written regarding a part of your research project and you conducted the research and prepared the manuscript you will be named as the first author. This policy is the same for all trainees. If other members of the team were involved in the work, they will also be listed as authors based on their contributions or alphabetically if their contributions were equal. No manuscripts will be submitted to any journal, conference etc. without the prior review and consent of all co-authors (this includes student co-authors). <br><br> <h3>Conflict resolution</h3> It is my expectation that if you are having a problem with someone else on the team that you will begin by approaching that person to discuss the problem openly. If the problem is not resolved to your satisfaction, then you are free to speak to me about the problem and I can help to mediate a remedy. If your problem is with me, please schedule an appointment so that we can discuss your concerns and try to remedy the problem. If you keep the problem to yourself there is no way for me to know that you are unhappy with the way things are going and, in my experience, most problems are easily remedied with an open discussion. <br><br><br> <h3>Team members</h3> The best way to know if you want to work with me, is to ask individuals that already done this decision. You can (and should) approach them directly so they can tell you the truth with all the pros and cons. I suggest mixing current and alumni to get the bigger picture.

			"description": "Publication authorship is one of the main recognitions researchers obtain for their research. It is therefore paramount to have a robust and acceptable system in place that ensures fairness and due process for disputes. The current system largely relies on the integrity of researchers but often fails when disputes arise. The use of an unbiased, data-driven model could overcome this limitation. In this study, we developed the first game-theory-inspired model to explore the dynamics of co-authorship disputes. The results are alarming and suggest that the current academic practices are not fit for purpose. Worryingly, our model shows that the number of potential disputes increases as the number of authors participating in the research increases, which is the global trend.",
