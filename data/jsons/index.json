Kaminka</a> and <a href='https://physics.biu.ac.il/en/node/1384' title='dr. chana wietman'>Dr. Chana Weitman</a>. <br><br> My research focuses on medical and biological nanoparticles (focusing on nanorobotics). Specifically, modeling a curing protocol based on biophysical interactions of targeted drug delivery nanoparticles in the blood. I am also interested in numerical solving and stabilization of ordinary and partial differential equations (ODE, PDE) systems (especially, ones that originate in a biological setup). Sometimes I am publishing some useful (or just fun) things like open code and technical blog posts . I published a few academic papers in journals, conferences, and abstracts. In between, I am teaching several mathematical classes and working with Bc.S. and Mc.S. students on their final project. <br><br>I completed my B.Sc. (2016) and M.Sc. (2018) in Applied Mathematics at Bar-Ilan University. <br>My <a href='https://teddylazebnik.info/files/cv.pdf' title='Teddy Lazebnik CV'>CV</a> can be found here. ",
