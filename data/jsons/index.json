         "name":"Computer aided functional style identifcation and correction in modern Russian texts",
         "description":"Functional style (FS) identification is a classification task in linguistics that categorizes unrestricted texts into several categories of linguistic norms. FS is widely used to attain a satisfying outcome in style processing. As such, we train a deep learning attention neural network model on modern-Russian texts, divide them into four FS categories. The model obtained an accuracy of 0.72. In particular, 81.08% and 85.71% accuracy in classifying the artistic and academic FS. The proposed model is able to automate the FS identification process and aids both domain experts and non-domain experts to perform FS correction by highlighting style anomalies concerning a desired style for the text. In particular, we show a 34% and 31% average improvement in the duration of performing the style correction task. Moreover, domain experts and non-domain experts obtain 3% and 9% more accurate results, respectively.",

         "description":"Multi-strain pandemics have emerged as a major concern. We introduce a new model for assessing the connection between multi-strain pandemics and mortality rate, basic reproduction number, and maximum infected individuals. The proposed model provides a general mathematical approach for representing multi-strain pandemics, generalizing for an arbitrary number of strains. We show that the proposed model fits well with epidemiological historical world health data over a long time period. From a theoretical point of view, we show that the increasing number of strains increases logarithmically the maximum number of infected individuals and the mean mortality rate. Moreover, the mean basic reproduction number is statistically identical to the single, most aggressive pandemic strain for multi-strain pandemics.",
