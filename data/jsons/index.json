   "biography":"I am a Ph.D. student in the Tolkien Project, part of the MAVERICK research group at the Computer Science Department , Bar Ilan University ; Supervised by Prof. Gal A. Kaminka and Dr. Chana Weitman. My research focuses on medical and biological nanoparticles (focusing on nanorobotics). Specifically, modeling a curing protocol based on biophysical interactions of targeted drug delivery nanoparticles in the blood. I am also interested in numerical solving and stabilization of ordinary and partial differential equations (ODE, PDE) systems (especially, ones that originate in a biological setup). Sometimes I am publishing some useful (or just fun) things like open code and technical blog posts . I published a few academic papers in journals, conferences, and abstracts. In between, I am teaching several mathematical classes and working with Bc.S. and Mc.S. students on their final project. I completed my B.Sc. (2016) and M.Sc. (2018) in Applied Mathematics at Bar-Ilan University.",
