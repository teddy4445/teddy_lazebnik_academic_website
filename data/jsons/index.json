   "biography":"I am Applied Mathematics and Computer Science researcher focusing on epidemiology, medical, economics, and information systems along with other secondary fields. I have ten years of experience in software development - five years developing desktop, web, and server applications and another five years developing algorithms. In between, seven years of experience leading development teams of up to ten professionals. A proven record in system architecture, production-ready algorithms, and working with clients. Specialization in bio-physical simulations (stable and accurate numerical calculation), big data analysis (in particular, social and economic data), NLP for information systems, and computer vision. I am interested in biomathematics, medical data-driven projects, biological and clinical processes modeling and simulation, eXplainable AI (XAI), and AI for video games.",

         "description":"We present a new analytical method to find the asymptotic stable equilibria states based on the Markov chain technique. We reveal this method on the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)-type epidemiological model that we developed for viral diseases with long-term immunity memory. This is a large-scale model containing 15 nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and classical methods have failed to analytically obtain its equilibria. The proposed method is used to conduct a comprehensive analysis by a stochastic representation of the dynamics of the model, followed by finding all asymptotic stable equilibrium states of the model for any values of parameters and initial conditions thanks to the symmetry of the population size over time.",

         "description":"We have developed an extended mathematical graph-based spatial-temporal SIR model, allowing a multidimensional analysis of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the pandemic spread, while assessing the economic losses caused by it. By incorporating into the model dynamics that are a consequence of the interrelationship between the pandemic and the economic crisis, such as job separation not as a result of workers’ morbidity, analysis were enriched. Controlling the spread of the pandemic and preventing outbreaks have been investigated using two NPIs: the duration of working and school days and lockdown to varying degrees among the adult and children populations. Based on the proposed model and data from the Israeli economy, allowing 7.5 working hours alongside 4.5 school hours would maximise output and prevent an outbreak, while minimising the death toll (0.48% of the population). Alternatively, an 89% lockdown among children and a 63% lockdown among adults will minimise the death toll (0.21%) while maximising output and preventing outbreaks.",
