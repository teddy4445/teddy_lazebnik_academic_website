   "biography":"I am a Ph.D. student in the Tolkien Project, part of the MAVERICK research group at the Computer Science Department , Bar Ilan University ; Supervised by Prof. Gal A. Kaminka and Dr. Chana Weitman. My research focuses on medical and biological nanoparticles (focusing on nanorobotics). Specifically, modeling a curing protocol based on biophysical interactions of targeted drug delivery nanoparticles in the blood. I am also interested in numerical solving and stabilization of ordinary and partial differential equations (ODE, PDE) systems (especially, ones that originate in a biological setup). Sometimes I am publishing some useful (or just fun) things like open code and technical blog posts . I published a few academic papers in journals, conferences, and abstracts. In between, I am teaching several mathematical classes and working with Bc.S. and Mc.S. students on their final project. I completed my B.Sc. (2016) and M.Sc. (2018) in Applied Mathematics at Bar-Ilan University.",

         "description":"The new COVID-19 pandemic has challenged policymakers on key issues. Most countries have adopted “lockdown” policies to reduce the spatial spread of COVID-19, but they have damaged the economic and moral fabric of society. Mathematical modeling in non-pharmaceutical intervention policy management has proven to be a major weapon in this fight due to the lack of an effective COVID-19 vaccine. We present a new \textit{hybrid} model for COVID-19 dynamics using both an age-structured mathematical model based on the SIRD model and spatio-temporal model in silico, analyzing the data of COVID-19 in Israel. Using the \textit{hybrid} model, we have introduced a method for estimating the reproduction number of an epidemic in real-time from the data of daily notification of cases. The results of the proposed model are confirmed by the Israeli Lockdown experience with a mean square error of 0.205 over two weeks. The use of mathematical models promises to reduce the uncertainty in the choice of “Lockdown” policies. Our unique use of contact details from 2 classes (children and adults), the interaction of populations depending on the time of day, and several physical locations, allowed a new look at the differential dynamics of the spread and control of infection",
