         "name":"A computational framework for physics-informed symbolic regression with straightforward integration of domain knowledge",
         "description":"Discovering a meaningful symbolic expression that explains experimental data is a fundamental challenge in many scientific fields. We present a novel, open-source computational framework called Scientist-Machine Equation Detector (SciMED), which integrates scientific discipline wisdom in a scientist-in-the-loop approach, with state-of-the-art symbolic regression (SR) methods. SciMED combines a wrapper selection method, that is based on a genetic algorithm, with automatic machine learning and two levels of SR methods. We test SciMED on five configurations of a settling sphere, with and without aerodynamic non-linear drag force, and with excessive noise in the measurements. We show that SciMED is sufficiently robust to discover the correct physically meaningful symbolic expressions from the data, and demonstrate how the integration of domain knowledge enhances its performance. Our results indicate better performance on these tasks than the state-of-the-art SR software packages , even in cases where no knowledge is integrated. Moreover, we demonstrate how SciMED can alert the user about possible missing features, unlike the majority of current SR systems.",

         "description":"Mankind has struggled with pathogens throughout history. In this context, the contribution of vaccines to the continued economic and social prosperity of humanity is enormous, but it is constantly threatened by the development of vaccine-resistant strains of the pathogen. In this study, we investigate the usage of genomic sequencing tests to detect new strains of a pathogen in a multi-strain pandemic scenario using a mathematical–epidemiological–genomic–economic model. Our model provides a theoretical framework to explore the influence of an extensive number of pharmaceutical interventions in a dynamic multi-strain pandemic. Specifically, we show that while a genomic sequence testing policy can be both economically and epidemiologically efficient, a random sample of the population provides sub-optimal results. Moreover, we demonstrate that the optimal policy is sensitive to the social and economic settings of the population, and provide a machine learning based model that offers a solution to these challenges.",

		 "name":"Predicting acute kidney injury following open partial nephrectomy treatment using SAT-pruned explainable machine learning model",
		 "description":"Background: One of the most prevalent complications of Partial Nephrectomy (PN) is Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), which could have a negative impact on subsequent renal function and occurs in up to 24.3% of patients undergoing PN. The aim of this study was to predict the occurrence of AKI following PN using preoperative parameters by applying machine learning algorithms. Methods We included all adult patients (n = 723) who underwent open PN in our department since 1995 and on whom we have data on the pre-operative renal function. We developed a random forest (RF) model with Boolean satisfaction-based pruned decision trees for binary classification (AKI or non-AKI). Hyper-parameter grid search was performed to optimize the model's performance. Fivefold cross-validation was applied to evaluate the model. We implemented a RF model with greedy feature selection to binary classify AKI and non-AKI cases based on pre-operative data. Results The best model obtained a 0.69 precision and 0.69 recall in classifying the AKI and non-AKI groups on average (k = 5). In addition, the model's probability to correctly classify a new prediction is 0.75. The proposed model is available as an online calculator. Conclusions Our model predicts the occurrence of AKI following open PN with (75%) accuracy. We plan to externally validate this model and modify it to minimally-invasive PN.",
