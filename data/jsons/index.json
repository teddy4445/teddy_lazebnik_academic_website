         "name":"Computer aided functional style identifcation and correction in modern russian texts",
         "description":"Functional style (FS) identification is a classification task in linguistics that categorizes unrestricted texts into several categories of linguistic norms. FS is widely used to attain a satisfying outcome in style processing. As such, we train a deep learning attention neural network model on modern-Russian texts, divide them into four FS categories. The model obtained an accuracy of 0.72. In particular, 81.08% and 85.71% accuracy in classifying the artistic and academic FS. The proposed model is able to automate the FS identification process and aids both domain experts and non-domain experts to perform FS correction by highlighting style anomalies concerning a desired style for the text. In particular, we show a 34% and 31% average improvement in the duration of performing the style correction task. Moreover, domain experts and non-domain experts obtain 3% and 9% more accurate results, respectively.",

         "description":"In this study, we propose a spatio-temporal, heterogeneous population model and in silico simulation to evaluate pandemic IPs in four types of buildings - home, office, school, and mall. We show that indeed each building type has a unique pandemic spread and therefore a different optimal IP. Moreover, we show that temporal-based IPs (such as mask wearing) have a similar influence on the pandemic spread in all four building types while spatial-based IPs (such as social distance) highly differ.",
