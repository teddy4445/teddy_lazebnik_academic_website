         "name":"A computational framework for physics-informed symbolic regression with straightforward integration of domain knowledge",
         "description":"Discovering a meaningful symbolic expression that explains experimental data is a fundamental challenge in many scientific fields. We present a novel, open-source computational framework called Scientist-Machine Equation Detector (SciMED), which integrates scientific discipline wisdom in a scientist-in-the-loop approach, with state-of-the-art symbolic regression (SR) methods. SciMED combines a wrapper selection method, that is based on a genetic algorithm, with automatic machine learning and two levels of SR methods. We test SciMED on five configurations of a settling sphere, with and without aerodynamic non-linear drag force, and with excessive noise in the measurements. We show that SciMED is sufficiently robust to discover the correct physically meaningful symbolic expressions from the data, and demonstrate how the integration of domain knowledge enhances its performance. Our results indicate better performance on these tasks than the state-of-the-art SR software packages , even in cases where no knowledge is integrated. Moreover, we demonstrate how SciMED can alert the user about possible missing features, unlike the majority of current SR systems.",

         "name":"Multi-species prey–predator dynamics during a multi-strain pandemic ",
         "description":"Small and large scale pandemics are a natural phenomenon repeatably appearing throughout history, causing ecological and biological shifts in ecosystems and a wide range of their habitats. These pandemics usually start with a single strain but shortly become multi-strain due to a mutation process of the pathogen causing the epidemic. In this study, we propose a novel eco-epidemiological model that captures multi-species prey–predator dynamics with a multi-strain pandemic. The proposed model extends and combines the Lotka–Volterra prey–predator model and the Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered epidemiological model. We investigate the ecosystem’s sensitivity and stability during such a multi-strain pandemic through extensive simulation relying on both synthetic cases as well as two real-world configurations. Our results are aligned with known ecological and epidemiological findings, thus supporting the adequacy of the proposed model in realistically capturing the complex eco-epidemiological properties of the multi-species multi-strain pandemic dynamics.",

         "description":"Trust has proven to be a predictor of organizational outcomes. In some cases, such as law enforcement, achieving organizational goals requires workers to be willing to risk their lives. Is there a link between street-level bureaucrats’ (SLBs) willingness to endanger their own lives for the public and their trust in their peers, managers, and the institution to which they belong? Using a national survey of 2,733 police officers in Brazil and machine-learning-based methods, we found that there is a significant link between their willingness to risk their lives for others and their trust in their peers, managers, and the institution to which they belong. Our findings indicate that while these SLBs were very willing to risk their lives for certain groups, their willingness declined sharply for others such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ)+ people and the homeless. In addition, police officers’ perceptions about discrimination, police professionalism, and organizational commitment and support are linearly linked to their willingness to risk their lives. Our findings demonstrate the important role of trust in understanding public servants’ practices in the extreme context of risking their lives for others.",
