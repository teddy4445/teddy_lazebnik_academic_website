Negotiating credit, resource distribution, and dynamics is akin to solving a puzzle. Addressing these challenges is crucial for fruitful teamwork. Research indicates early conflicts in authorship credit, highlighting a systemic issue in academia. Strategies include understanding co-authors on a personal level, agreeing on authors' list order, task delegation, and mediation mechanisms. An exit strategy is essential for irreconcilable differences. While effective, these strategies might challenge traditional norms, requiring a balance between pragmatic navigation and academic goodwill. Acknowledging the impact of collaborators, this blog post advocates for constructive collaboration."

The first two AI players are based on deterministic algorithms (greedy and MinMax) while the third is based on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. We train the RL player based on historical games (offline) and then personalize it using online learning against specific player. An experiment conducted with five levels of human players show that the RL is able to win 44% of the time (greedy and MinMax win 14% and 32%, respectively) making it a valid AI player."

         "description":"Academic collaboration is pivotal for groundbreaking research but comes with unspoken complexities. Negotiating credit, resource distribution, and dynamics is akin to solving a puzzle. Addressing these challenges is crucial for fruitful teamwork. Research indicates early conflicts in authorship credit, highlighting a systemic issue in academia. Strategies include understanding co-authors on a personal level, agreeing on authors' list order, task delegation, and mediation mechanisms. An exit strategy is essential for irreconcilable differences. While effective, these strategies might challenge traditional norms, requiring a balance between pragmatic navigation and academic goodwill. Acknowledging the impact of collaborators, this blog post advocates for constructive collaboration."

         "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a rolling crisis that required policymakers around the world to take action to manage the pandemic spread. During the period where vaccination was not available, the pandemic spread management lied in non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). A large number of mathematical models have been proposed to predict the pandemic spread and analyze the influence of various NPIs on multiple scenarios, getting more accurate and sophisticated over time. In this post, we review the latest mathematical models for pandemic spread NPIs and their main limitations. Specifically, the usage of modeling a homogeneous population rather than a heterogeneous one."
