         "description":"This work introduces the first model of immunotherapy treatment, namely the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). The model takes into consideration the interaction network between multiple immune cell types and compartments. A set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced to capture the connectivity between these variables and the clinical presentation of the disease. Four subsets of the T1D mice and healthy controls that exhibit normal and high-level glucose consumption are evaluated using the proposed model. Numerical results obtained for mice suggest that BCG treatment of the T1D patients that follow healthy eating habits normalizes glucose to levels observed in non-diabetic controls. Furthermore, glucose consumption profoundly influences disease progression. This outcome suggests that immunotherapy may modulate molecular and cellular manifestations of the disease but it does not eliminate T1D. Of note, our data, obtained from numerical simulations, indicate that the BCG immunotherapy treatment may benefit healthy controls on a high-glucose diet and can be used as a tool for further clinical investigation of BCG usage to control T1D.",

         "name":"Computational Applications of Extended SIR Models: A Review Focused on Airborne Pandemics",
         "description":"Epidemiological-Mathematical models are powerful tools for estimating the course of a pandemic and exploring different scenarios through pandemic intervention policies (PIPs). These models are commonly developed to provide decision-support tools for policymakers who are forced to make difficult decisions in a timely manner. Done properly, these models are able to provide a safe, quick, and cheap solution for this challenge. There are numerous types of mathematical models for epidemiological disease spread and control. However, in order to become applicative tools for decision-making, the modelers of these models are required to overcome three computational challenges: efficiently define the model, develop it as computer software, and fit it into historical data. Performed efficiently, one can use the obtained tool to explore possible scenarios and PIPs. In this paper, we present a critical review of models that extend the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and explore the efficiency of these models, their software characteristics, and model performance on real-world data. We further provide a guide for epidemiological-mathematical model development and implementation, exploring several modeling approaches and their respective implementation options. Lastly, we outline the current trends, limitations, and opportunities in this field. In particular, we find that the spatial properties of a model play a critical role in its accuracy and ability to explain historical pandemic spread, especially in the context of airborne diseases. Moreover, we show that agent-based simulations are preferable over partial/ordinary differential solvers when considering a highly-realistic pandemic model or focusing on a relatively small population size.",

         "description":"There are two main approaches to tackle the challenge of finding the best filter or embedded feature selection (FS) algorithm: searching for the one best FS algorithm and creating an ensemble of all available FS algorithms. However, in practice, these two processes usually occur as part of a larger machine learning pipeline and not separately. We posit that, due to the influence of the filter FS on the embedded FS, one should aim to optimize both of them as a single FS pipeline rather than separately. We propose a meta-learning approach that automatically finds the best filter and embedded FS pipeline for a given dataset called FSPL. We demonstrate the performance of FSPL on n = 90 datasets, obtaining 0.496 accuracy for the optimal FS pipeline, revealing an improvement of up to 5.98 percent in the model’s accuracy compared to the second-best meta-learning method.",

         "description":"Cancer is one of the most common families of diseases today with millions of new patients every year around the world. Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most prevalent types of cancer affecting both genders, and it is not known to be associated with a specific group in the population. The current treatment standard for BC follows a standard weekly Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy-based therapy protocol which includes BCG and IL-2 injections. Unfortunately, due to the biological and clinical complexity of the interactions between the immune system, treatment, and cancer cells, clinical outcomes vary significantly among patients. Unfortunately, existing models are commonly developed for a non-existing average patient or pose strict, unrealistic, expectations on the treatment process. In this work, we propose the most extensive ordinary differential equation-based biological model of BCG treatment to date and a deep learning-based scheduling approach to obtain a personalized treatment schedule. Our results show that resulting treatment schedules favorably compare with the current standard practices and the current state-of-the-art scheduling approach.",

         "description":"A decision tree (DT) is one of the most popular and efficient techniques in data mining. Specifically, in the clinical domain, DTs have been widely used thanks to their relatively easy explainable nature, efficient computation time, and relatively accurate predictions. However, some DT constriction algorithms may produce a large tree size structure which is difficult to understand and often leads to misclassification of data in the testing process due to poor generalization. Post pruning (PP) algorithms have been introduced to reduce the size of the tree structure with a minor (or not at all) decrease in the accuracy of classification while trying to improve the model’s generalization. In this paper, we propose a new Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based PP algorithm called SAT-PP. Our algorithm reduces the tree size while preserving the accuracy of the unpruned tree. We implemented our algorithm on a medical-related classification data sets since in medical-related tasks we emphatically try to avoid decreasing the model’s performance when better training is not an option. Namely, in the case of medical-related tasks, one may prefer an unpruned DT model to a pruned DT model with worse performance. Indeed, we empirically obtained that the SAT-PP algorithm produce the same accuracy and F1 score as the DT model without PP while statistically significantly reducing the model size and as a result computation time (6.8%). In addition, we compared the proposed algorithm with other PP algorithms and found similar generalization capabilities.",

         "description":"During a global epidemiological crisis, lockdowns and border closures substantially disrupt international supply chains, underscoring the importance of choosing an intervention policy that accounts for the unique structure of input-output linkages among domestic industries. This study develops a pioneering mathematical model to quantify the role of pandemic-related intervention policies in the economic impact of a pandemic outbreak in an economy where sectors are complements throughout input-output networks. Our approach is based on three pillars - epidemiological, social, and economic sub-models. Moreover, we present in silico computer simulations to examine the influence of work capsules, work-from-home, vaccination, and industry closure on the damage a pandemic could inflict on output at the industry level. A comparison between work capsules and work-from-home policies shows that the latter decreases economic loss much more than the former. Compared to a state without interventions, a work-from-home policy affecting 12% of the workforce will decrease output loss by 1.4 percentage points during an epidemiological crisis following a COVID-19-like outbreak. Under the constraint of choosing one intervention policy, vaccination significantly reduces the loss of output, particularly in industries that require close customer-seller contacts. In the analysis of scenarios of integrating intervention policies, it is found that, using direct marginal contribution as the measure, the vaccination intervention is approximately 4.5 times more effective in reducing output loss than the work-from-home intervention.",

This study provides a new approach to more accurately estimate the size of the non-observed economy using machine learning methods. Compared to two currency demand-based models used to estimate the size of the non-observed economy, we show that a Random Forest algorithm can more accurately estimate the demand for currency, which is known to provide a fair estimation of the unregistered economic activity.

We present a novel, open-source computational framework called Scientist-Machine Equation Detector (SciMED), which integrates scientific discipline wisdom in a scientist-in-the-loop approach, with state-of-the-art symbolic regression (SR) methods. SciMED combines a wrapper selection method, that is based on a genetic algorithm, with automatic machine learning and two levels of SR methods. We test SciMED on five configurations of a settling sphere, with and without aerodynamic non-linear drag force, and with excessive noise in the measurements. We show that SciMED is sufficiently robust to discover the correct physically meaningful symbolic expressions from the data, and demonstrate how the integration of domain knowledge enhances its performance. Our results indicate better performance on these tasks than the state-of-the-art SR software packages , even in cases where no knowledge is integrated. Moreover, we demonstrate how SciMED can alert the user about possible missing features, unlike the majority of current SR systems.",

Researchers have developed multiple mathematical models and computational frameworks to investigate and predict pandemic spread on various levels and scales such as countries, cities, large social events, and even buildings. However, attempts of modeling airborne pandemic dynamics on the smallest scale, a single room, have been mostly neglected. As time indoors increases due to global urbanization processes, more infections occur in shared rooms. In this study, a high-resolution spatio-temporal epidemiological model with airflow dynamics to evaluate airborne pandemic spread is proposed. The model is implemented, using Python, with high-resolution 3D data obtained from a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) device and computing model based on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for the airflow and the Susceptible–Exposed–Infected (SEI) model for the epidemiological dynamics. The pandemic spread is evaluated in four types of rooms, showing significant differences even for a short exposure duration. We show that the room’s topology and individual distribution in the room define the ability of air ventilation to reduce pandemic spread throughout breathing zone infection.",

We strongly encourage authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, but without headings: (1) Background: place the question addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; (2) Methods: describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; (3) Results: summarize the article’s main findings; (4) Conclusions: indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an objective representation of the article, it must not contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions. Airborne diseases cause high mortality and adverse socioeconomic consequences. Due to urbanization, more people spend more time indoors. According to recent research, air ventilation reduces long-range airborne transmission in indoor settings. However, air ventilation solutions often incur significant energy costs and ecological footprints. The trade-offs between energy consumption and pandemic control indoors have not yet been thoroughly analyzed. In this work, we use advanced sensors to monitor the energy consumption and pandemic control capabilities of an air-conditioning system, a pedestal fan, and an open window in hospital rooms, classrooms, and conference rooms. A simulation of an indoor airborne pandemic spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) is used to analyze the Pareto front. For the three examined room types, the Pareto front consists of all three air ventilation solutions, with some ventilation configurations demonstrating significant inefficiencies. Specifically, air-conditioning is found to be efficient only at a very high energy cost and fans seem to pose a reasonable alternative. To conclude, a more informed ventilation policy can bring about a more desirable compromise between energy consumption and pandemic spread control.",

Multiple treatments for non-invasive, superficial bladder cancer have been proposed over the last several decades with a weekly Bacillus Calmette–Guérin immunotherapy-based therapy protocol, which is considered the gold standard today. Nonetheless, due to the complexity of the interactions between the immune system, healthy cells, and cancer cells in the bladder’s microenvironment, clinical outcomes vary significantly among patients. Mathematical models are shown to be effective in predicting the treatment outcome based on the patient’s clinical condition at the beginning of the treatment. Even so, these models still have large errors for long-term treatments and patients that they do not fit. In this work, we utilize modern mathematical tools and propose a novel cell-level spatio-temporal mathematical model that takes into consideration the cell–cell and cell–environment interactions occurring in a realistic bladder’s geometric configuration in order to reduce these errors. We implement the model using the agent-based simulation approach, showing the impacts of different cancer tumor sizes and locations at the beginning of the treatment on the clinical outcomes for today’s gold-standard treatment protocol. In addition, we propose a genetic-algorithm-based approach to finding a successful and time-optimal treatment protocol for a given patient’s initial condition. Our results show that the current standard treatment protocol can be modified to produce cancer-free equilibrium for deeper cancer cells in the urothelium if the cancer cells’ spatial distribution is known, resulting in a greater success rate.",

In this study, we begin to examine the influence of multiple psychological parameters on employees’ work engagement (WE) within the public sector. The idea is to break the concept of WE down into eight individually measurable parameters that will allow for a better understanding and development of stronger interventions. Based on this analysis, we reproduce the outcome that strategic clarity is the most connected property to WE. More importantly, we introduce a new concept, honest mistakes, and show that having a safe space for making mistakes and learning from it is the second most important property of WE. This result is of interest, as allowing mistakes, even if they were made innocently, is considered taboo in the public sector. These outcomes are based on the reports of n=7682 public sector employees from Brazil. In particular, the analysis shows that these outcomes hold for both professional and management positions across the health, administrative, justice, police, social work, and education offices. ",

         "description":"Background: One of the most prevalent complications of Partial Nephrectomy (PN) is Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), which could have a negative impact on subsequent renal function and occurs in up to 24.3% of patients undergoing PN. The aim of this study was to predict the occurrence of AKI following PN using preoperative parameters by applying machine learning algorithms. Methods We included all adult patients (n = 723) who underwent open PN in our department since 1995 and on whom we have data on the pre-operative renal function. We developed a random forest (RF) model with Boolean satisfaction-based pruned decision trees for binary classification (AKI or non-AKI). Hyper-parameter grid search was performed to optimize the model's performance. Fivefold cross-validation was applied to evaluate the model. We implemented a RF model with greedy feature selection to binary classify AKI and non-AKI cases based on pre-operative data. Results The best model obtained a 0.69 precision and 0.69 recall in classifying the AKI and non-AKI groups on average (k = 5). In addition, the model's probability to correctly classify a new prediction is 0.75. The proposed model is available as an online calculator. Conclusions Our model predicts the occurrence of AKI following open PN with (75%) accuracy. We plan to externally validate this model and modify it to minimally-invasive PN.",

The proposed model provides a general mathematical approach for representing multi-strain pandemics, generalizing for an arbitrary number of strains. We show that the proposed model fits well with epidemiological historical world health data over a long time period. From a theoretical point of view, we show that the increasing number of strains increases logarithmically the maximum number of infected individuals and the mean mortality rate.

While this new pedagogic paradigm (PP) holds a promise of better learning and training, it comes with challenges as traditional PPs are not suited to the new settings which highly differ from the physical classroom methods. We studied three online PPs (Synchronous, Asynchronous, and Asynchronous with an audience) and their influence on the students learning process and achievements during an academic mathematics course that was conducted online. 168 students took an exam and answered a questionnaire regarding their learning preferences, experience, and habits after experiencing one of these PPs. We found that students who studied according to the asynchronous with an audience PP achieved a higher score in the exam, regardless of their initial level than students who learned by either the synchronous or asynchronous PPs. In addition, we developed a personalized model based on machine learning methods that match an online PP for each student to maximize the student’s score in the exam. In the case of an academic mathematical course, the online PP had a major influence on the students’ scores in the exam. We found that students with high grades in previous courses preferred synchronous learning, which indicates the importance of picking the right online PP for each student. Our model provides a novel tool for the pedagogic community to personalize online learning by recommending the PP that could be most suitable for each student.",

         "description":"In recent years, much attention has been focused on the impact of climate change, particularly via ocean acidification (OA), on marine organisms. Studying the impact of OA on long-living organisms, such as sharks, is especially challenging. When the ocean waters absorb anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), slow-growing shark species with long generation times may be subjected to stress, leading to a decrease in functionality. Our goal was to examine the behavioral and physiological responses of sharks to OA and the possible impacts on their fitness and resilience. We conducted a systematic review in line with PRISMA-Analyses, of previously reported scientific experiments. We found that most studies used CO2 partial pressures (pCO2) that reflect representative concentration pathways for the year 2100 (e.g., pH ~7.8, pCO2 ~1000 μatm). Since there is a considerable knowledge gap on the effect of OA on sharks, we utilized existing data on bony fish to synthesize the available knowledge. Given the similarities between the behaviors and physiology of these two superclasses’ to changes in CO2 and pH levels, there is merit in including the available information on bony fish as well. Several studies indicated a decrease in shark fitness in relation to increased OA and CO2 levels. However, the decrease was species-specific and influenced by the intensity of the change in atmospheric CO2 concentration and other anthropogenic and environmental factors (e.g., fishing, temperature). Most studies involved only limited exposure to future environmental conditions and were conducted on benthic shark species studied in the laboratory rather than on apex predator species. While knowledge gaps exist, and more research is required, we conclude that anthropogenic factors are likely contributing to shark species’ vulnerability worldwide. However, the impact of OA on the long-term stability of shark populations is not unequivocal.",

Epidemiological models can be used to better understand pandemic dynamics and assist policymakers in optimizing their Intervention Policies (IPs). Most existing epidemiological models assume, sometimes incorrectly, that a pandemic is caused by a single pathogen, ignoring pathogen mutations over time that result in different pathogen variants with different characteristics. In addition, the existing models do not incorporate the effect of IPs like vaccinations and lockdowns during the fitting phase. In this work, we introduce a new multi-mutation model called Suspected-Infected-Vaccinated-Recovered-reInfected (SIVRI). This model extends the SIRS model with adaptation to incorporate available knowledge related to the different pathogen mutations together with multiple IPs. In order to find the model parameters we propose a new fitting procedure that supports the complex social, epidemiological, and clinical dynamics that occur during a pandemic. We examine the suggested SIVRI model in comparison to the SIRS and XGboost models on the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel that includes four COVID-19 mutations, and the vaccination and lockdown IPs. We show that the proposed model can fit accurately to the historical data and outperform the existing models in predictions of basic reproduction number, mortality rate, and severely infected individuals rate.",

Successful pandemic IPs have to take into consideration the heterogeneous behavior of individuals in different types of buildings and social contexts. In this study, we propose a spatio-temporal, heterogeneous population model and in silico simulation to evaluate pandemic IPs in four types of buildings - home, office, school, and mall. We show that indeed each building type has a unique pandemic spread and therefore a different optimal IP. Moreover, we show that temporal-based IPs (such as mask wearing) have a similar influence on the pandemic spread in all four building types while spatial-based IPs (such as social distance) highly differ.",

Most countries have adopted “lockdown” policies to reduce the spatial spread of COVID-19, but they have damaged the economic and moral fabric of society. Mathematical modeling in non-pharmaceutical intervention policy management has proven to be a major weapon in this fight due to the lack of an effective COVID-19 vaccine. We present a new \textit{hybrid} model for COVID-19 dynamics using both an age-structured mathematical model based on the SIRD model and spatio-temporal model in silico, analyzing the data of COVID-19 in Israel. Using the \textit{hybrid} model, we have introduced a method for estimating the reproduction number of an epidemic in real-time from the data of daily notification of cases. The results of the proposed model are confirmed by the Israeli Lockdown experience with a mean square error of 0.205 over two weeks. The use of mathematical models promises to reduce the uncertainty in the choice of “Lockdown” policies. Our unique use of contact details from 2 classes (children and adults), the interaction of populations depending on the time of day, and several physical locations, allowed a new look at the differential dynamics of the spread and control of infection.",
