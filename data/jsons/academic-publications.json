         "name":"A Machine Learning-Based Guide for Repeated Laboratory Testing in Pediatric Emergency Departments",
         "description":"Background/Objectives: Laboratory tests conducted in community settings are occasionally repeated within hours of presentation to pediatric emergency departments (PEDs). Reducing unnecessary repetitions can ease child discomfort and alleviate the healthcare burden without compromising the diagnostic process or quality of care. The aim of this study was to develop a decision tree (DT) model to guide physicians in minimizing unnecessary repeat blood tests in PEDs. The minimal decision tree (MDT) algorithm was selected for its interpretability and capacity to generate optimally pruned classification trees. Methods: Children aged 3 months to 18 years with community-based complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte (ELE), and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements obtained between 2016 and 2023 were included. Repeat tests performed in the pediatric emergency department within 12 h were evaluated by comparing paired measurements, with tests considered justified when values transitioned from normal to abnormal ranges or changed by ≥20%. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted for absolute change thresholds of 10% and 30% and for repeat intervals of 6, 18, and 24 h. Results: Among 7813 children visits in this study, 6044, 1941, and 2771 underwent repeated CBC, ELE, and CRP tests, respectively. The mean ages of patients undergoing CRP, ELE, and CBC testing were 6.33 ± 5.38, 7.91 ± 5.71, and 5.08 ± 5.28 years, respectively. The majority were of middle socio-economic class, with 66.61–71.24% living in urban areas. Pain was the predominant presented complaint (83.69–85.99%), and in most cases (83.69–85.99%), the examination was conducted by a pediatrician. The DT model was developed and evaluated on training and validation cohorts, and it demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the need for repeat CBC and ELE tests but not CRP. Performance of the DT model significantly exceeded that of the logistic regression model. Conclusions: The data-driven guide derived from the DT model provides clinicians with a practical, interpretable tool to minimize unnecessary repeat laboratory testing, thereby enhancing patient care and optimizing healthcare resource utilization.",

         "description":"Fire weather indices (FWIs) are widely used to assess wildfire risk, but are typically designed for specific regions and not adapted globally. Here, we present a systematic effort to generate country-specific FWIs that capture regional fire-weather patterns. We evaluate three widely used indices across countries, finding that the Canadian FWI performs best overall (ROC AUC of 0.69). Tailoring the index to each country with a Genetic Algorithm significantly improves its accuracy, raising the ROC AUC from 0.69 to 0.79. To further improve accuracy while maintaining interpretability, we develop a single Decision Tree model per country, achieving an ROC AUC of 0.86. Attempts to develop a single global Decision Tree yielded substantially lower accuracy, highlighting the limitations of universal models and the importance of capturing regional characteristics such as weather patterns, vegetation types, and topography for accurately predicting wildfire risk. Adapting FWIs regionally is crucial under accelerating climate change conditions.",

         "description":"The analysis of high-dimensional timeline data and the identification of outliers and anomalies are critical across diverse domains, including sensor readings, biological and medical data, historical records, and global statistics. However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity. These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features, outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability—a cognitive science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected deviations—we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from the expected behavior. LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods, enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of the State of the Union Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that LvS transformation enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and the most variable features along the timeline.",

         "description":"Scholarly communication is vital to scientific advancement, enabling the exchange of ideas and knowledge. When selecting publication venues, scholars consider various factors, such as journal relevance, reputation, outreach, and editorial standards and practices. However, some of these factors are inconspicuous or inconsistent across venues and individual publications. This study proposes that scholars' decision-making process can be conceptualized and explored through the biologically inspired exploration-exploitation (EE) framework, which posits that scholars balance between familiar and under-explored publication venues. Building on the EE framework, we introduce a grounded definition for “Home Venues” (HVs) – an informal concept used to describe the set of venues where a scholar consistently publishes – and investigate their emergence and key characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the publication patterns of roughly three-quarters of computer science scholars align with the expectations of the EE framework. For these scholars, HVs typically emerge and stabilize after approximately 15-20 publications. Additionally, scholars with higher h-indexes, greater number of publications, or higher academic age tend to have higher-ranking journals as their HVs.",

Using a national survey among a representative sample of 2,733 police officers in Brazil, we found a significant correlation between SLBs’ perceptions regarding their organisations’ readiness for emergencies and their trust in their peers, managers, and the institutions to which they belong. Our findings, therefore, highlight the important role of trust in SLBs’ perceptions of readiness for emergencies. We show that, while there is a linear correlation between the two factors, a non-linear correlation provides a better explanation of the connection, revealing a complex sociological dynamic between trust and perceptions of readiness. We also discuss the implications of our findings and suggest an agenda for future research.",

         "name":"A blood test-based machine learning model for predicting lung cancer risk",
         "description":"Background: The goal of early detection is individual cancer prediction. For lung cancer (LC), age and smoking history are the primary criteria for annual low-dose CT screening, leaving other populations at risk of being overlooked. Machine learning (ML) is a promising method to identify complex patterns in the data that can reveal personalized disease predictors. Methods: An ML-based model was used on blood test data collected before the diagnosis of LC, and sociodemographic factors such as age and gender among LC patients and controls were incorporated to predict the risk for future LC diagnosis. Results: In addition to age and gender, we identified 22 blood tests that contributed to the model. For the entire study population, the ML model predicted LC with an accuracy of 71.2%, a sensitivity of 63%, and a positive predictive value of 67.2%. Higher accuracy was found among women than men (71.8 vs. 70.8) and among never smokers than smokers (73.6 vs. 70.1%). Age was the most significant contributor (13.6%), followed by red blood cell distribution (5.1%), creatinine (5%), gender (3.6%), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (3.3%). A majority of the blood tests made a highly variable contribution to the complex ML model; however, some tests, such as red cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, prothrombin time, hematocrit, urea, and calcium, contributed slightly more to a dichotomous prediction. Conclusion: Blood tests can be used in the proposed ML model to predict LC. More studies are needed in basic science fields to identify possible explanations between specific blood results and LC prediction.",

         "name":"The Academic Midas Touch: A citation-based indicator of research excellence",
         "description":"Purpose: This paper introduces a novel perspective on academic excellence, focusing on a researcher’s consistent ability to produce highly-cited publications, and demonstrates its utility in distinguishing high- achieving scientists compared to traditional scientometric indicators. Design/methodology/approach: We formulate this new perspective using a simple yet effective indicator termed the 'Academic Midas Touch' (AMT). We then empirically analyze how AMT aligns with or diverges from popular scientometrics such as the H-index, i10-index, and citation counts. We further evaluate AMT’s effectiveness in identifying award-winning scientists, using these awards as a proxy for recognized academic excellence. Findings: Our empirical analysis reveals that the AMT offers a distinct measure of academic excellence that does not fully correlate with commonly used scientometrics. Furthermore, AMT favorably compares to these traditional metrics in its ability to accurately identify award-winning scientists. Research limitations: The AMT emphasizes short-term citation accumulation, thus it may overlook long-term dynamics such as 'sleeping beauties'. Additionally, mindful parameter tuning and contextual interpretation within a specific discipline or a meaningful cohort of peers are necessary. Finally, the AMT does not seek to fully capture the multidimensional complexities of research excellence such as collaborations, mentoring, and societal impact. Practical implications: The findings suggest that AMT can serve as a valuable complementary tool for evaluating researchers, particularly in contexts such as excellence recognition, award nominations, grant applications, and faculty promotions, providing an under-explored view of a researcher’s consistent ability to produce highly-influential publications. Originality/value: This work introduces a unique conceptualization and measurement of academic excellence, shifting the focus from cumulative impact to the consistent propensity for producing highly-cited publications. The resulting AMT indicator provides a fresh perspective that complements existing scientometrics, offering a more nuanced understanding and recognition of research excellence.",

A possible future pandemic raises a dilemma for business owners between short-term profitability and long-term supply chain resilience preparedness. In this study, we propose a novel agent-based simulation model that integrates epidemiological dynamics using a Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered–Dead (SEIRD) model, a supply and demand economic model, and a spatial representation of supply chain networks to evaluate supply chain resilience preparedness strategies during pandemics. Using this model, we explore a range of supply chain resilience preparedness strategies under pandemic scenarios using in silico experiments. Our analysis shows that the exact supply chain resilience preparedness strategy is hard to obtain for each firm and is relatively sensitive to the exact profile of the pandemic and economic state at the beginning of the pandemic. As such, we used a machine learning model that uses agent-based simulation to estimate a near-optimal supply chain resilience preparedness strategy for a firm.",

         "description":"Objectives: Large-scale crises, including wars and pandemics, have repeatedly shaped human history, and their simultaneous occurrence presents profound challenges to societies. Understanding the dynamics of epidemic spread during warfare is essential for developing effective containment strategies in complex conflict zones. While research has explored epidemic models in various settings, the impact of warfare on epidemic dynamics remains underexplored. Methods: We proposed a novel mathematical model that integrates the epidemiological SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with the war dynamics Lanchester model to explore the dual influence of war and pandemic on a population’s mortality. Moreover, we consider a dual-use military and civil health care system that aims to reduce the overall mortality rate, which can use different administration policies such as prioritizing soldiers over civilians. Using an agent-based simulation to generate in silico data, we trained a deep reinforcement learning model based on the deep Q-network algorithm for health care administration policy and conducted an intensive investigation on its performance.Results: Our results show that a pandemic during war conduces chaotic dynamics where the health care system should either prioritize war-injured soldiers or pandemic-infected civilians based on the immediate amount of mortality from each option, ignoring long-term objectives. Conclusions:  Our findings highlight the importance of integrating conflict-related factors into epidemic modeling to enhance preparedness and response strategies in conflict-affected areas.",

In this study, we investigate solo-authorship dynamics at the individual scholar level, a perspective often overlooked in favor of publication-level analyses, focusing on the propensity of scholars to solo-publish over their careers and this propensity’s potential relation to their academic influence. Using a dataset of 7238 scholars from Biology, Computer Science, Psychology, and Philosophy, we analyze the temporal solo-authorship patterns through heatmap analysis, time series clustering, and statistical testing. By formally defining and analyzing the notion of the academic “Lone Wolf” - a scholar who persistently solo-publishes at a high rate - we show that a global definition of a Lone Wolf may seem unreasonable. Nevertheless, we identify three characteristic solo-authorship trajectories across the four disciplines that share several commonalities and highly their differences.

         "description":"Arterial hypotension is a common and often unintended event during surgery under general anesthesia, associated with increased postoperative complications, such as kidney injury, myocardial injury, and stroke. Postinduction hypotension (PIH) is influenced by patient-specific factors, chronic medication use, and anesthetic induction regimens. Traditional predictive models struggle with this complexity, making machine learning (ML) a promising alternative due to its ability to handle complex datasets and identify hidden patterns. This study aimed to develop and validate an ML-based model for predicting PIH and identifying key clinical predictors. A retrospective cohort study of 20,309 adult patients undergoing non-obstetric surgery under general anesthesia with intravenous induction was conducted. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PIH, defined as mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 55 mmHg within 10 min post-induction. Data were split into training and validation sets using k-fold cross-validation. The model’s predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and feature importance was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. PIH occurred in 4,948 patients (24.4%). Key predictors included preinduction systolic and mean arterial pressures, propofol dose, and beta-blocker use. The ML model achieved an AUC of 0.732 in predicting PIH. The ML-based model demonstrated significant predictive capability for PIH, identifying key clinical predictors. This model holds the potential for improving preoperative planning and patient risk stratification. However, further validation through prospective studies is necessary to confirm these findings.",

         "description":"There have been shifts toward more systematic and standardized methods for studying non-human primate facial signals, thanks to advancements like animalFACS. Additionally, there have been calls to better integrate the study of both facial and gestural communication in terms of theory and methodology. However, few studies have taken this important integrative step. By doing so, researchers could gain greater insight into how the physical flexibility of facial signals affects social flexibility. Our study combines both approaches to examine the relationship between the flexibility of physical form and the social function of chimpanzee facial 'gestures'. We used chimpFACS along with established gestural ethograms that provide insights into four key gesture properties and their associated variables documented in chimpanzee gestures. We specifically investigated how the combinatorics (i.e., the different combinations of facial muscle movements) and complexity (measured by the number of discrete facial muscle movements) of chimpanzee facial signals varied based on: (1) how many gesture variables they exhibit; (2) the presence of a specific goal; and (3) the context in which they were produced. Our findings indicate that facial signals produced with vocalizations exhibit fewer gesture variables, rarely align with specific goals, and exhibit reduced contextual flexibility. Furthermore, facial signals that include additional visual movements (such as those of the head) and other visual signals (like manual gestures) exhibit more gestural variables, are frequently aligned with specific goals, and exhibit greater contextual flexibility. Finally, we discovered that facial signals become more morphologically complex when they exhibit a greater number of gesture variables. Our findings indicate that facial 'gesturing' significantly enhanced the facial signaling repertoire of chimpanzees, offering insights into the evolution of complex communication systems like human language.",

The research aims to model the socio-economic implications of increasing transfer payments to interest group members who abstain from labor market participation. Using an innovative differential equation model, the study evaluates the long-term impact on utility for both the broader working population and interest group members. Key findings indicate that while increased allowances enhance private consumption for interest group members, they paradoxically reduce the overall provision of public goods due to a decline in working contributors. This depletion negatively impacts utility and eventually diminishes benefits for the interest group members. The model underscores a tipping point where, beyond a critical level of allowance, public good provision and utility are compromised. The study combines theoretical analysis with sensitivity tests to assess the effects of allowance levels, tax burden, utility, and population growth rates. Results demonstrate that sustained increases in allowances can accelerate the transition of working individuals to non-working status, ultimately destabilizing both public good provision and the utility balance across populations.",

When using ML models in realistic and dynamic environments, users often need to handle the challenge of concept drift (CD). In this study, we explore the application of genetic algorithms (GAs) to address the challenges posed by CD in such settings. Formally, we propose a novel two-level ensemble ML model, which combines a global ML model with a CD detector, operating as an aggregator for a population of ML pipeline models, each one with an adjusted CD detector by itself responsible for re-training its ML model. In addition, we show that one can further improve the proposed model by utilizing off-the-shelf automatic ML (AutoML) methods. Through extensive synthetic dataset analysis, we show that the proposed model statistically significantly outperforms an ML pipeline with a CD algorithm, particularly in scenarios with unknown CD characteristics or a mixture of moving and shifting CDs. Moreover, we show a sub-linear decline in the proposed method’s performance with respect to a higher drifting rate and robustness to the underlying AutoML method utilized.",

Around the same time, schol- ars’ departures from their advisors’ writing styles seem to converge as well.

         "description":"Primates demonstrate variability regarding the degree to which they display status hierarchies, which are influenced by a multitude of demographic and ecological factors. Additionally, primates must manage their interactions within these social hierarchies through the use of diverse communicative signals, including facial signals and manual gestures. Often times, these variables are assessed independently; however, it is probable that they collectively influence social rankings among primates. Our study investigates the application and accuracy of data‐driven techniques, based on the genetic algorithm approach, in capturing social rankings among a group of captive chimpanzees, focusing on the analysis of communicative and demographic factors. We utilize observational data collected from a group of 18 chimpanzees residing at the Los Angeles Zoo from 2017 to 2019, derived from three previous studies carried out by the first author (BF). Our data‐driven model exhibited a high degree of accuracy in capturing established social hierarchies in 2017, in addition to identifying notable fluctuations in rankings during periods of social instability from 2018 to 2019, especially in the aftermath of the passing of the highest‐ranking female in the troop. Feature importance analysis revealed that social bond strength, measured via the dyadic composite sociality index (DCSI), was the most significant predictor of rank, highlighting the importance of social bonding in shaping status hierarchies. These models provide valuable insights for future research on primate behavior and social structures, as well as assist in making informed decisions for zoo management.",

Moreover, it is a frequent cause of distress and dissatisfaction in the early postoperative period. Currently, the classical scores used for predicting PONV have not yielded satisfactory results. Therefore, prognostic models for the prediction of early and delayed PONV were developed in this study to achieve satisfactory predictive performance. Methods The retrospective data of inpatient adult patients admitted to the post‑anesthesia care unit after undergoing surgical procedures under general anesthesia at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel, between September 1, 2018, and September 1, 2023, were used in this study. An ensemble model of machine‑learning algorithms trained on the data of 35,003 patients was developed. The k‑fold cross‑validation method was used followed by splitting the data to train and test sets that optimally preserve the sociodemographic features of the patients. Results Among the 35,003 patients, early and delayed PONV were observed in 1,340 (3.82%) and 6,582 (18.80%) patients, respectively. The proposed PONV prediction models correctly predicted early and delayed PONV in 83.6% and 74.8% of cases, respectively, outperforming the second‑best PONV prediction score (Koivuranta score) by 13.0% and 10.4%, respectively. Feature importance analysis revealed that the performance of the proposed prediction tools aligned with previous clinical knowledge, indicating their utility. Conclusions The machine learning‑based models developed in this study enabled improved PONV prediction, thereby facilitating personalized care and improved patient outcomes.",

As wildfires are also affected by climate change, extreme wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent. Although they occur less frequently globally than those sparked by human activities, lightning-ignited wildfires play a substantial role in carbon emissions and account for the majority of burned areas in certain regions. While existing computational models, especially those based on machine learning, aim to predict lightning-ignited wildfires, they are typically tailored to specific regions with unique characteristics, limiting their global applicability. In this study, we present machine learning models designed to characterize and predict lightning-ignited wildfires on a global scale. Our approach involves classifying lightning-ignited versus anthropogenic wildfires, and estimating with high accuracy the probability of lightning to ignite a fire based on a wide spectrum of factors such as meteorological conditions and vegetation. Utilizing these models, we analyze seasonal and spatial trends in lightning-ignited wildfires shedding light on the impact of climate change on this phenomenon. We analyze the influence of various features on the models using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) frameworks. Our findings highlight significant global differences between anthropogenic and lightning-ignited wildfires. Moreover, we demonstrate that, even over a short time span of less than a decade, climate changes have steadily increased the global risk of lightning-ignited wildfires. This distinction underscores the imperative need for dedicated predictive models and fire weather indices tailored specifically to each type of wildfire.",

However, after a period of remission, some cancer cells changed into androgen-independent cells, and then treatment proceeds with a combination of ADT and chemotherapy. Senescent cells are cells that stop dividing but sustain viability. Senescence cancer cells are common in cancer, and they affect cancer treatment negatively by secreting inflammatory cytokines and pro-cancer VEGF. In this paper, we include the effect of senescence in a model of mPC. We consider combinations of ADT, chemotherapy, and senolytic drug, which eliminate senescent cells, in a spatio-temporal partial differential equations model, and demonstrate that simulations of the model are in agreement with experimental results. We evaluate the synergy between different doses of chemotherapy and senolytic drugs, at different fixed doses of ADT. We also consider optimal scheduling of the drugs, and the hypothesis that, in optimal schedule, a senolytic drug is to be administered immediately following the chemotherapy drug.",

To develop an objective tool for tremor analysis to be used before and after focused ultrasound thalamotomy treatment in the treated hand (contralateral to ablation) and non-treated (ipsilateral to ablation). Using image processing and signal processing that utilized images of a Archimedes spiral drawing, we created a tool to analyze tremor. First, we showed that the proposed tool reproduces known clinical dynamics on the treated hand, and then we used it to evaluate the clinical dynamics on the non-treated hand. Using the tool we developed, we were able to demonstrate a significant reduction in tremor following focused ultrasound thalamotomy among 132 essential tremor and 26 tremor-dominant Parkinson’s disease patients in the treated hand using drawings of Archimedes spirals up to 1 year following the procedure. Thus, we reproduced known clinical data and therefore validated the proposed tool. In addition, we were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in the non-treated hand as well as a significant deterioration in the efficacy of focused ultrasound thalamotomy over time. Our objective method, which incorporated image processing and signal processing, provided a quantitative measure of tremor reduction following focused ultrasound thalamotomy. It demonstrated significant improvement in tremors in the treated and non-treated hands following focused ultrasound thalamotomy as well as deterioration in the efficacy of treatment over time.

Cellular senescence is the hallmark of aging, but senescence also appears in cancer, triggered by cells stress, tumor suppression of gene activation, and oncogene activity. In lung cancer, senescent cancer cells secrete VEGF, which initiates a process of angiogenesis, enabling the cancer to grow and proliferate. Chemotherapy kills cancer cells, but some cancer cells become senescent. Hence, a senolytic drug, a drug that eliminates senescent cells, should significantly improve the efficacy of chemotherapy. In this paper, we developed a mathematical spatio-temporal model of combination chemotherapy with senolytic drug in treatment of lung cancer. Model’s simulations of tumor volume growth are shown to agree with mouse experiments in the case where cyclophosphamide is combined with the senolytic drug fisetin. It is then shown how the model can be used to assess the benefits of treatments with different combinations and different schedules of the two drugs in order to achieve optimal tumor volume reduction.",

These models are based on an intuitive, but frequently unsatisfied, assumption that the data used to train these models is well-representing the task at hand. This gives rise to the out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge which can cause an unexpected drop in the data-driven model's performance. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various ML and DL models in in-distribution (ID) versus OOD prediction. While the degradation in OOD performance is well acknowledged, to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to quantify it for various models on a large benchmark n = 15 real-world regression datasets. We extensively (runs) compare the ID versus OOD performance of XGBoost, random forest, K-nearest-neighbors, support vector machine, and linear regression models, as well as AutoML models (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool and AutoKeras). In addition, to tackle this challenge, we propose to integrate a symbolic regression (SR) as a feature engineering method model with an ML or DL model to improve its performance for OOD samples. Our results show that the incorporation of SR-derived features significantly enhances the predictive capabilities of both ML and DL models with 3.70% and 10.20%, on average, of the OOD samples, respectively, without reducing ID performance and in fact improving it to a slightly lower extent. As such, this method can help produce more generalized and robust data-driven models.",

Specifically, landmark-based geometric morphometric methods have been used to objectively assess facial expressions in cats, focusing on pain recognition and the impact of breed-specific morphology on facial signaling. These methods employed a 48-landmark scheme grounded in cat facial anatomy. Manually annotating these landmarks, however, is a labor-intensive process, deeming it impractical for generating sufficiently large amounts of data for machine learning purposes and for use in applied real-time contexts with cats. Our previous work introduced an AI pipeline for automated landmark detection, which showed good performance in standard machine learning metrics. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of fully automated, end-to-end landmark-based systems for practical cat facial analysis tasks remained underexplored. In this paper we develop AI pipelines for three benchmark tasks using two previously collected datasets of cat faces. The tasks include automated cat breed recognition, cephalic type recognition and pain recognition. Our fully automated end-to-end pipelines reached accuracy of 75% and 66% in cephalic type and pain recognition respectively, suggesting that landmark-based approaches hold promise for automated pain assessment and morphological explorations.",

Domestication may have shifted feline social dynamics towards a greater emphasis on facial signals that promote affiliative bonding. Most studies have focused on cat facial signals during human interactions or in response to pain. Research on intraspecific facial communication in cats has predominantly examined non-affiliative social interactions. A recent study by Scott and Florkiewicz1 demonstrated significant differences between cats’ facial signals during affiliative and non-affiliative intraspecific interactions. This follow-up study applies computational approaches to make two main contributions. First, we develop a machine learning classifier for affiliative/non-affiliative interactions based on manual CatFACS codings and automatically detected facial landmarks, reaching above 77% in CatFACS codings and 68% in landmarks by integrating a temporal dimension. Secondly, we introduce novel measures for rapid facial mimicry based on CatFACS coding. Our analysis suggests that domestic cats exhibit more rapid facial mimicry in affiliative contexts than non-affiliative ones, which is consistent with the proposed function of mimicry. Moreover, we found that ear movements (such as EAD103 and EAD104) are highly prone to rapid facial mimicry. Our research introduces new possibilities for analyzing cat facial signals and exploring shared moods with innovative AI-based approaches.",

         "description":"Zoonotic disease transmission between animals and humans is a growing risk, and the agricultural context acts as a likely point of transition, with an important role of individual heterogeneity. Livestock often occurs at high local densities, facilitating spread within sites (e.g. among cows in a dairy farm), while wildlife is often more mobile, potentially connecting spatially isolated sites. Thus, understanding the dynamics of disease spread in the wildlife-livestock interface is crucial for mitigating these risks of transmission. Specifically, the interactions between pigeons (Columba livia, also known as ‘rock doves’) and in-door cows at dairy farms can lead to significant disease transmission and economic losses for farmers; putting livestock, adjacent human populations, and other wildlife species at risk. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal multi-pathogen model with continuous spatial movement. The model expands on the SEIRD framework and accounts for both within-species and cross-species transmission of pathogens, as well as the exploration–exploitation movement dynamics of pigeons, which play a critical role in the spread of infectious agents. In addition to model formulation, we also implement it as an agent-based simulation approach and use empirical field data to investigate different biologically realistic scenarios, evaluating the effect of various parameters on the epidemic spread. Namely, in agreement with theoretical expectations, the model predicts that the heterogeneity of the movement dynamics of pigeons (on top and beyond the obvious effect of an increase of mean level movement itself) can drastically affect both the magnitude and stability of outbreaks. In addition, joint infection by multiple pathogens can have an interactive effect, reflecting a non-intuitive inhibition of the outbreak compared to predictions from single-pathogen SIR models. Our findings highlight the impact of heterogeneity in host behavior on their pathogens and allow realistic predictions of outbreak dynamics in the multi-pathogen wildlife-livestock interface with consequences to zoonotic diseases in various systems.",

Facial behaviors linked to pain have attracted most of the attention so far in non-human animals, leading to the development of numerous instruments for evaluating pain through facial expressions for various animal species. Nevertheless, manual facial expression analysis is susceptible to subjectivity and bias, is labor-intensive and often necessitates specialized expertise and training. This challenge has spurred a growing body of research into automated pain recognition, which has been explored for multiple species, including cats. In our previous studies, we have presented and studied artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines for automated pain recognition in cats using 48 facial landmarks grounded in cats’ facial musculature, as well as an automated detector of these landmarks. However, so far automated recognition of pain in cats used solely static information obtained from hand-picked single images of good quality. This study takes a significant step forward in fully automated pain detection applications by presenting an end-to-end AI pipeline that requires no manual efforts in the selection of suitable images or their landmark annotation. By working with video rather than still images, this new pipeline approach also optimises the temporal dimension of visual information capture in a way that is not practical to preform manually. The presented pipeline reaches over 70% and 66% accuracy respectively in two different cat pain datasets, outperforming previous automated landmark-based approaches using single frames under similar conditions, indicating that dynamics matter in cat pain recognition. We further define metrics for measuring different dimensions of deficiencies in datasets with animal pain faces, and investigate their impact on the performance of the presented pain recognition AI pipeline.",

Through extensive simulations for the case of Colombia, a country that consists mostly of small-size coffee farms and is the second-largest coffee producer in the world, our results show that it is economically impractical to sustain any profit without directly tackling the rust pandemic. Furthermore, even in the hypothetical case where farmers perfectly know their farm’s epidemiological state and the weather in advance, any rust pandemic-related efforts can only amount to a limited profit of roughly 4% on investment. In the more realistic case, any rust pandemic-related efforts are expected to result in economic losses, indicating that major disturbances in the coffee market are anticipated.",

In parallel, in the ever-evolving landscape of digital social interactions, the pervasive utilization of dating apps has become a prominent facet of modern society. Despite the surge in popularity and the profound impact on relationship formation, a crucial gap in the literature persists regarding the potential ramifications of dating apps usage on the dynamics of STDs. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a novel mathematical framework - an extended Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemiological model to elucidate the intricate interplay between dating apps engagement and the propagation of STDs. Namely, as dating apps are designed to make users revisit them and have mainly casual sexual interactions with other users, they increase the number of causal partners, which increases the overall spread of STDS. Using extensive simulation, based on real-world data, explore the effect of dating apps adoption and control on the STD spread. We show that an increased adoption of dating apps can result in an STD outbreak if not handled appropriately.",

Machine learning (ML) models that can predict disease risk are an emerging method in medicine for identifying hidden associations that are personally unique. Materials and methods: Using the tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT), we developed an ML-based model, which is an ensemble of the Random Forest and XGboost models, based on known risk factors for LC, as part of a larger trial for ML prediction using electronic medical records and chest CT. We used data from patients with LC vs. controls (1:2) of patients aged ≥ 35 years. We developed a model for all LC patients as well as for patients with and without a smoking background. We included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, socioeconomic status (SES), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema/chronic bronchitis (CB), interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pulmonary fibrosis (PF), and family history of LC. Results: Of the 4076 patients, 1428 (35 %) were in the LC group and 2648 (65 %) were in the control group. For the entire study population, our model achieved an accuracy of 71.2 %, with a sensitivity of 69 % and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 74 %. Higher accuracy was achieved for the two subgroups. An accuracy of 74.8 % (sensitivity 72 %, PPV 76 %) and 73.0 % (sensitivity 76 %, PPV 72 %) was achieved for the smoking and never-smoking cohorts, respectively. For the entire population and smoker cohort, COPD/emphysema/CB were the most important contributors, followed by BMI and age, while in the never-smoking cohort, BMI, age and SES were the most important contributors. Conclusion: Known risk factors for LC could be used in ML models to modestly predict LC. Further studies are needed to confirm these results in new patients and to improve them.",

This study uses the EE model to explain male moth pheromone-driven flight paths. Wind tunnel measurements and 3D tracking using infrared cameras have been leveraged to gain insights into male moth behavior. During the experiments in the wind tunnel, disturbance to the airflow has been added and the effect of increased fluctuations on moth flights has been analyzed, in the context of the proposed EE model. The exploration and exploitation phases are separated using a genetic algorithm to the experimentally-obtained dataset of moth 3D trajectories. First, the exploration-to-exploitation rate (EER) increases with distance from the source of the female pheromone is demonstrated, which can be explained in the context of the EE model. Furthermore, our findings reveal a compelling relationship between EER and increased flow fluctuations near the pheromone source. Using an olfactory navigation simulation and our moth-inspired navigation model, the phenomenon where male moths exhibit an enhanced EER as turbulence levels increase is explained. This research extends our understanding of optimal navigation strategies based on general biological EE models and supports the development of bio-inspired navigation algorithms.",

Traditional approaches of FE often rely on domain expertise to manually design features for machine learning (ML) models. In the context of DL models, the FE is embedded in the neural network's architecture, making it hard for interpretation. In this study, we propose to integrate symbolic regression (SR) as an FE process before a ML model to improve its performance. We show, through extensive experimentation on synthetic and 21 real-world datasets, that the incorporation of SR-derived features significantly enhances the predictive capabilities of both machine and DL regression models with 34%–86% root mean square error (RMSE) improvement in synthetic datasets and 4%–11.5% improvement in real-world datasets. In an additional realistic use case, we show the proposed method improves the ML performance in predicting superconducting critical temperatures based on Eliashberg theory by more than 20% in terms of RMSE. These results outline the potential of SR as an FE component in data-driven models, improving them in terms of performance and interpretability.",

The performance of other models downstream in the computational process highly depends on the quality of data encoding. One of the most powerful ways to encode data is using the neural network AutoEncoder (AE) architecture. However, the developers of AE cannot easily influence the produced embedding space, as it is usually treated as a black box technique. This means the embedding space is uncontrollable and does not necessarily possess the properties desired for downstream tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach for developing AE models that can integrate external knowledge sources into the learning process, possibly leading to more accurate results. The proposed Knowledge-integrated AutoEncoder (KiAE) model can leverage domain-specific information to make sure the desired distance and neighborhood properties between samples are preservative in the embedding space. The proposed model is evaluated on three large-scale datasets from three scientific fields and is compared to nine existing encoding models. The results demonstrate that the KiAE model effectively captures the underlying structures and relationships between the input data and external knowledge, meaning it generates a more useful representation. This leads to outperforming the rest of the models in terms of reconstruction accuracy.",

To address this shortcoming, we propose a new definition for FS stability inspired by Lyapunov stability in dynamic systems. We show the proposed definition is statistically different from the classical record-stability on (n=90) datasets.

The introduction of outside stimuli for dogs in this environment can improve their welfare and life conditions. However, our current understanding of the influence of different stimuli on shelter dogs’ welfare is limited and the data is still insufficient to draw conclusions. In this study, we collected 28 days (four weeks) of telemetry data from eight male dogs housed in an Italian shelter for a long period of time. During this period, three types of enrichment were introduced into the dogs’ pens for one week each: entertaining objects, intraspecific, and interspecific social enrichment, by means of the presence of female conspecifics and the presence of a human. To quantify their impact, we introduce novel metrics as indicators of sheltered dogs’ welfare based on telemetry data: the variation of heart rate, muscle activity, and body temperature from an average baseline day, quality of sleep, and the regularity for cyclicity of the aforementioned parameters, based on the day-night cycle. Using these metrics, we show that while all three stimuli statistically improve the dogs’ welfare, the variance between individual dogs is large. Moreover, our findings indicate that the presence of female conspecific is the best stimulus among the three explored options which improves both the quality of sleep and the parameters’ cyclicity. Our results are consistent with previous research findings while providing novel data-driven welfare indicators that promote objectivity.

One such promising approach is the use of vocal indicators. The acoustic structure of vocalizations and their functions were extensively studied in important livestock species, such as pigs, horses, poultry, and goats, yet cattle remain understudied in this context to date. Cows were shown to produce two types of vocalizations: low-frequency calls (LF), produced with the mouth closed, or partially closed, for close distance contacts, and open mouth emitted high-frequency calls (HF), produced for long-distance communication, with the latter considered to be largely associated with negative affective states. Moreover, cattle vocalizations were shown to contain information on individuality across a wide range of contexts, both negative and positive. Nowadays, dairy cows are facing a series of negative challenges and stressors in a typical production cycle, making vocalizations during negative affective states of special interest for research. One contribution of this study is providing the largest to date pre-processed (clean from noises) dataset of lactating adult multiparous dairy cows during negative affective states induced by visual isolation challenges. Here, we present two computational frameworks—deep learning based and explainable machine learning based, to classify high and low-frequency cattle calls and individual cow voice recognition.

Using ML, the study explores new correlations that collapse the data gathered in this and in previous work by Verso et al. (2019). The “delay time”, which is the time between the particle exiting the interfacial layer and reaching a steady-state velocity, is found to strongly depend on six dimensionless parameters formulated by ML feature selection. The data shows a correlation between the Reynolds and Froude numbers within the range of the experiments, and the best symbolic regression is based on the Froude number only. This experiment provides valuable insights into the behavior of inertial particles in stratified layers and highlights opportunities for future improvement in predicting their motion.",

OFEE uses intersections of feature sets to produce a feature ensemble that optimally balances explainability and performance. Furthermore, OFEE is parameter-free and as such optimizes itself to a given dataset and explainability requirements. To evaluated OFEE, we considered two explainability measures, one based on ensemble size and the other based on ensemble stability. We found that OFEE was overall extremely effective within the nine canonical datasets we considered.

Therefore, most countries have adopted some level of border closure policies as one of the first steps in handling pandemics. However, this step involves a significant economic loss, especially for countries that rely on tourism as a source of income. We developed a pioneering model to help decision-makers determine the optimal border closure policies during a health crisis that minimize the magnitude of the outbreak and maximize the revenue of the tourism industry.

         "description":"Behavioral traits in dogs are assessed for a wide range of purposes such as determining selection for breeding, chance of being adopted or prediction of working aptitude. Most methods for assessing behavioral traits are questionnaire or observation-based, requiring significant amounts of time, effort and expertise. In addition, these methods might be also susceptible to subjectivity and bias, negatively impacting their reliability. In this study, we proposed an automated computational approach that may provide a more objective, robust and resource-efficient alternative to current solutions. Using part of a ‘Stranger Test’ protocol, we tested n = 53 dogs for their response to the presence and neutral actions of a stranger. Dog coping styles were scored by three dog behavior experts. Moreover, data were collected from their owners/trainers using the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). An unsupervised clustering of the dogs’ trajectories revealed two main clusters showing a significant difference in the stranger-directed fear C-BARQ category, as well as a good separation between (sufficiently) relaxed dogs and dogs with excessive behaviors towards strangers based on expert scoring. Based on the clustering, we obtained a machine learning classifier for expert scoring of coping styles towards strangers, which reached an accuracy of 78%. We also obtained a regression model predicting C-BARQ scores with varying performance, the best being Owner-Directed Aggression (with a mean average error of 0.108) and Excitability (with a mean square error of 0.032). This case study demonstrates a novel paradigm of ‘machine-based’ dog behavioral assessment, highlighting the value and great promise of AI in this context.",

Our machine learning model, which was based on the Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) automatic machine learning method, for DD detection on day 0 of the appearance of the clinical signs has reached an accuracy of 79% on the test set, while the model for the prediction of DD 2 days prior to the appearance of the first clinical signs, which was a combination of K-means and TPOT, has reached an accuracy of 64%. The proposed machine learning models have the potential to help achieve a real-time automated tool for monitoring and diagnosing DD in lactating dairy cows based on sensor data in conventional dairy barn environments.

         "description":"The early and accurate diagnosis of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) in dogs is pivotal for effective treatment and enhanced canine well-being. Owners often do underestimate the severity of BOAS in their dogs. In addition, traditional diagnostic methods, which include pharyngolaryngeal auscultation, are often compromised by subjectivity, are time-intensive and depend on the veterinary surgeon’s experience. Hence, new fast, reliable assessment methods for BOAS are required. The aim of the current study was to use machine learning techniques to bridge this scientific gap. In this study, machine learning models were employed to objectively analyze 366 audio samples from 69 Pugs and 79 other brachycephalic breeds, recorded with an electronic stethoscope during a 15-min standardized exercise test. In classifying the BOAS test results as to whether the dog is affected or not, our models achieved a peak accuracy of 0.85, using subsets from the Pugs dataset. For predictions of the BOAS results from recordings at rest in Pugs and various brachycephalic breeds, accuracies of 0.68 and 0.65 were observed, respectively. Notably, the detection of laryngeal sounds achieved an F1 score of 0.80. These results highlight the potential of machine learning models to significantly streamline the examination process, offering a more objective assessment than traditional methods. This research indicates a turning point towards a data-driven, objective, and efficient approach in canine health assessment, fostering standardized and objective BOAS diagnostics.",

Recently, there has been an increasing number of false claims found in academic manuscripts, casting doubt on the validity of reported results. In this paper, we utilize an adapted version of Benford’s law, a statistical phenomenon that describes the distribution of leading digits in naturally occurring datasets, to identify the potential manipulation of results in research manuscripts, solely using the aggregated data presented in those manuscripts rather than the commonly unavailable raw datasets. Our methodology applies the principles of Benford’s law to commonly employed analyses in academic manuscripts, thus reducing the need for the raw data itself. To validate our approach, we employed 100 open-source datasets and successfully predicted 79% of them accurately using our rules. Moreover, we tested the proposed method on known retracted manuscripts, showing that around half (48.6%) can be detected using the proposed method. Additionally, we analyzed 100 manuscripts published in the last two years across ten prominent economic journals, with 10 manuscripts randomly sampled from each journal. Our analysis predicted a 3% occurrence of results manipulation with a 96% confidence level. Our findings show that Benford’s law adapted for aggregated data, can be an initial tool for identifying data manipulation; however, it is not a silver bullet, requiring further investigation for each flagged manuscript due to the relatively low prediction accuracy.",

These pandemics usually start with a single strain but shortly become multi-strain due to a mutation process of the pathogen causing the epidemic. In this study, we propose a novel eco-epidemiological model that captures multi-species prey–predator dynamics with a multi-strain pandemic. The proposed model extends and combines the Lotka–Volterra prey–predator model and the Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered epidemiological model. We investigate the ecosystem’s sensitivity and stability during such a multi-strain pandemic through extensive simulation relying on both synthetic cases as well as two real-world configurations. Our results are aligned with known ecological and epidemiological findings, thus supporting the adequacy of the proposed model in realistically capturing the complex eco-epidemiological properties of the multi-species multi-strain pandemic dynamics.",

Commonly, during CM the individuals of the group avoid collisions. These CM and collision avoidance (CA) behaviors are based on input from the environment such as smell, air pressure, and vision, all of which are processed by the individual and defined action. In this work, a novel vision-based CM with CA model (i.e., VCMCA) simulating the collective evolution learning process is proposed. In this setting, a learning agent obtains a visual signal about its environment, and throughout trial-and-error over multiple attempts, the individual learns to perform a local CM with CA which emerges into a global CM with CA dynamics. The proposed algorithm was evaluated in the case of locusts’ swarms, showing the evolution of these behaviors in a swarm from the learning process of the individual in the swarm. Thus, this work proposes a biologically-inspired learning process to obtain multi-agent multi-objective dynamics.",

However, forecasting state government tax revenues using only aggregate economic variables is subject to Lucas’s critique, which is left not fully answered as classical methods do not consider the complex feedback dynamics between heterogeneous consumers, businesses, and the government. In this study we present an agent-based model with a heterogeneous population and genetic algorithm-based decision-making to model and simulate an economy with taxation policy dynamics. The model focuses on assessing state tax revenues obtained from regions or cities within countries while introducing consumers and businesses, each with unique attributes and a decision-making mechanism driven by an adaptive genetic algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on a small village, resulting in a mean relative error of 5.44 +- 2.34 percent from the recorded taxes over 4 years and 4.08 +- 1.21 percent for the following year’s assessment. Moreover, we demonstrate the model’s ability to evaluate the effect of different taxation policies on economic activity and tax revenues.",

Such frameworks intelligently search among millions of possible ML pipelines - typically containing feature engineering, model selection, and hyper parameters tuning steps - and finally output an optimal pipeline in terms of predictive accuracy. However, when the dataset is large, each individual configuration takes longer to execute, therefore the overall AutoML running times become increasingly high. To this end, we present SubStrat, an AutoML optimization strategy that tackles the data size, rather than configuration space. It wraps existing AutoML tools, and instead of executing them directly on the entire dataset, SubStrat uses a genetic-based algorithm to find a small yet representative data subset that preserves a particular characteristic of the full data. It then employs the AutoML tool on the small subset, and finally, it refines the resulting pipeline by executing a restricted, much shorter, AutoML process on the large dataset. ",

Thanks to technological advancements, many millions of healthy and diseased genomes have already been sequenced; however, obtaining the most suitable data for a specific study, and specifically for validation studies, remains challenging with respect to scale and access. Therefore, in silico genomics sequence generators have been proposed as a possible solution. However, the current generators produce inferior data using mostly shallow (stochastic) connections, detected with limited computational complexity in the training data. This means they do not take the appropriate biological relations and constraints, that originally caused the observed connections, into consideration. To address this issue, we propose cancer-inspired genomics mapper model (CGMM), that combines genetic algorithm (GA) and deep learning (DL) methods to tackle this challenge. CGMM mimics processes that generate genetic variations and mutations to transform readily available control genomes into genomes with the desired phenotypes. We demonstrate that CGMM can generate synthetic genomes of selected phenotypes such as ancestry and cancer that are indistinguishable from real genomes of such phenotypes, based on unsupervised clustering. Our results show that CGMM outperforms four current state-of-the-art genomics generators on two different tasks, suggesting that CGMM will be suitable for a wide range of purposes in genomic medicine, especially for much-needed validation studies.",

Recent studies show that machine learning solutions are able to produce better HSRA results compared to manual planning. However, these outcomes usually focused on a single hospital and objective. In this paper, we solve the HSRA task using a novel agent-based simulation with a deep reinforcement learning agent. We used real-world data to generate a wide range of synthetic instances that were used to train the HSRA agent. Our results show that the proposed model is able to achieve better outcomes in terms of patient treatment success and cost-effectiveness compared to previous resource allocation algorithms. We show that different planning horizons obtain similar performance in handling anomalies. In addition, we show a second-order polynomial connection between the patient treatment success and both the hospital’s initial budget and funding over time.

Recently, with the advancement of machine learning (ML) and other artificial intelligence (AI) methods, researchers can now solve complex economic tasks with previously unseen performance and ease. However, to use such methods, one is required to have a non-trivial level of expertise in ML or AI, which currently is not standard knowledge in economics. In order to bridge this gap, automatic machine learning (AutoML) models have been developed, allowing non-experts to efficiently use advanced ML models with their data. Nonetheless, not all AutoML models are created equal in general, particularly for the unique properties associated with economic data. In this paper, we present a benchmarking study of biologically inspired and other AutoML techniques for economic tasks. We evaluate four different AutoML models alongside two baseline methods using a set of 50 diverse economic tasks. Our results show that biologically inspired AutoML models (slightly) outperformed non-biological AutoML in economic tasks, while all AutoML models outperformed the traditional methods.

The model takes into consideration the interaction network between multiple immune cell types and compartments. A set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced to capture the connectivity between these variables and the clinical presentation of the disease. Four subsets of the T1D mice and healthy controls that exhibit normal and high-level glucose consumption are evaluated using the proposed model. Numerical results obtained for mice suggest that BCG treatment of the T1D patients that follow healthy eating habits normalizes glucose to levels observed in non-diabetic controls. Furthermore, glucose consumption profoundly influences disease progression. This outcome suggests that immunotherapy may modulate molecular and cellular manifestations of the disease but it does not eliminate T1D. Of note, our data, obtained from numerical simulations, indicate that the BCG immunotherapy treatment may benefit healthy controls on a high-glucose diet and can be used as a tool for further clinical investigation of BCG usage to control T1D.",

However, in order to become applicative tools for decision-making, the modelers of these models are required to overcome three computational challenges: efficiently define the model, develop it as computer software, and fit it into historical data. Performed efficiently, one can use the obtained tool to explore possible scenarios and PIPs. In this paper, we present a critical review of models that extend the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and explore the efficiency of these models, their software characteristics, and model performance on real-world data. We further provide a guide for epidemiological-mathematical model development and implementation, exploring several modeling approaches and their respective implementation options. Lastly, we outline the current trends, limitations, and opportunities in this field. In particular, we find that the spatial properties of a model play a critical role in its accuracy and ability to explain historical pandemic spread, especially in the context of airborne diseases. Moreover, we show that agent-based simulations are preferable over partial/ordinary differential solvers when considering a highly-realistic pandemic model or focusing on a relatively small population size.",

However, in practice, these two processes usually occur as part of a larger machine learning pipeline and not separately. We posit that, due to the influence of the filter FS on the embedded FS, one should aim to optimize both of them as a single FS pipeline rather than separately. We propose a meta-learning approach that automatically finds the best filter and embedded FS pipeline for a given dataset called FSPL. We demonstrate the performance of FSPL on n = 90 datasets, obtaining 0.496 accuracy for the optimal FS pipeline, revealing an improvement of up to 5.98 percent in the model’s accuracy compared to the second-best meta-learning method.",

Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most prevalent types of cancer affecting both genders, and it is not known to be associated with a specific group in the population. The current treatment standard for BC follows a standard weekly Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy-based therapy protocol which includes BCG and IL-2 injections. Unfortunately, due to the biological and clinical complexity of the interactions between the immune system, treatment, and cancer cells, clinical outcomes vary significantly among patients. Unfortunately, existing models are commonly developed for a non-existing average patient or pose strict, unrealistic, expectations on the treatment process. In this work, we propose the most extensive ordinary differential equation-based biological model of BCG treatment to date and a deep learning-based scheduling approach to obtain a personalized treatment schedule. Our results show that resulting treatment schedules favorably compare with the current standard practices and the current state-of-the-art scheduling approach.",

         "description":"A decision tree (DT) is one of the most popular and efficient techniques in data mining. Specifically, in the clinical domain, DTs have been widely used thanks to their relatively easy explainable nature, efficient computation time, and relatively accurate predictions. However, some DT constriction algorithms may produce a large tree size structure which is difficult to understand and often leads to misclassification of data in the testing process due to poor generalization. Post pruning (PP) algorithms have been introduced to reduce the size of the tree structure with a minor (or not at all) decrease in the accuracy of classification while trying to improve the model’s generalization. In this paper, we propose a new Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based PP algorithm called SAT-PP. Our algorithm reduces the tree size while preserving the accuracy of the unpruned tree. We implemented our algorithm on a medical-related classification data sets since in medical-related tasks we emphatically try to avoid decreasing the model’s performance when better training is not an option. Namely, in the case of medical-related tasks, one may prefer an unpruned DT model to a pruned DT model with worse performance. Indeed, we empirically obtained that the SAT-PP algorithm produce the same accuracy and F1 score as the DT model without PP while statistically significantly reducing the model size and as a result computation time (6.8%). In addition, we compared the proposed algorithm with other PP algorithms and found similar generalization capabilities.",

This study develops a pioneering mathematical model to quantify the role of pandemic-related intervention policies in the economic impact of a pandemic outbreak in an economy where sectors are complements throughout input-output networks. Our approach is based on three pillars - epidemiological, social, and economic sub-models. Moreover, we present in silico computer simulations to examine the influence of work capsules, work-from-home, vaccination, and industry closure on the damage a pandemic could inflict on output at the industry level. A comparison between work capsules and work-from-home policies shows that the latter decreases economic loss much more than the former. Compared to a state without interventions, a work-from-home policy affecting 12% of the workforce will decrease output loss by 1.4 percentage points during an epidemiological crisis following a COVID-19-like outbreak. Under the constraint of choosing one intervention policy, vaccination significantly reduces the loss of output, particularly in industries that require close customer-seller contacts. In the analysis of scenarios of integrating intervention policies, it is found that, using direct marginal contribution as the measure, the vaccination intervention is approximately 4.5 times more effective in reducing output loss than the work-from-home intervention.",

By exploring the signals and predictive modeling for a situation with no lockdown implementation, the lockdown was found as a critical factor in distress rising among the general population, which could affect long after the improvement in pandemic case counts.

Researchers have developed multiple mathematical models and computational frameworks to investigate and predict pandemic spread on various levels and scales such as countries, cities, large social events, and even buildings. However, attempts of modeling airborne pandemic dynamics on the smallest scale, a single room, have been mostly neglected. As time indoors increases due to global urbanization processes, more infections occur in shared rooms. In this study, a high-resolution spatio-temporal epidemiological model with airflow dynamics to evaluate airborne pandemic spread is proposed. The model is implemented, using Python, with high-resolution 3D data obtained from a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) device and computing model based on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for the airflow and the Susceptible–Exposed–Infected (SEI) model for the epidemiological dynamics. The pandemic spread is evaluated in four types of rooms, showing significant differences even for a short exposure duration. We show that the room’s topology and individual distribution in the room define the ability of air ventilation to reduce pandemic spread throughout breathing zone infection.",

The abstract should be an objective representation of the article, it must not contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions. Airborne diseases cause high mortality and adverse socioeconomic consequences. Due to urbanization, more people spend more time indoors. According to recent research, air ventilation reduces long-range airborne transmission in indoor settings. However, air ventilation solutions often incur significant energy costs and ecological footprints. The trade-offs between energy consumption and pandemic control indoors have not yet been thoroughly analyzed. In this work, we use advanced sensors to monitor the energy consumption and pandemic control capabilities of an air-conditioning system, a pedestal fan, and an open window in hospital rooms, classrooms, and conference rooms. A simulation of an indoor airborne pandemic spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) is used to analyze the Pareto front. For the three examined room types, the Pareto front consists of all three air ventilation solutions, with some ventilation configurations demonstrating significant inefficiencies. Specifically, air-conditioning is found to be efficient only at a very high energy cost and fans seem to pose a reasonable alternative. To conclude, a more informed ventilation policy can bring about a more desirable compromise between energy consumption and pandemic spread control.",

Multiple treatments for non-invasive, superficial bladder cancer have been proposed over the last several decades with a weekly Bacillus Calmette–Guérin immunotherapy-based therapy protocol, which is considered the gold standard today. Nonetheless, due to the complexity of the interactions between the immune system, healthy cells, and cancer cells in the bladder’s microenvironment, clinical outcomes vary significantly among patients. Mathematical models are shown to be effective in predicting the treatment outcome based on the patient’s clinical condition at the beginning of the treatment. Even so, these models still have large errors for long-term treatments and patients that they do not fit. In this work, we utilize modern mathematical tools and propose a novel cell-level spatio-temporal mathematical model that takes into consideration the cell–cell and cell–environment interactions occurring in a realistic bladder’s geometric configuration in order to reduce these errors. We implement the model using the agent-based simulation approach, showing the impacts of different cancer tumor sizes and locations at the beginning of the treatment on the clinical outcomes for today’s gold-standard treatment protocol. In addition, we propose a genetic-algorithm-based approach to finding a successful and time-optimal treatment protocol for a given patient’s initial condition. Our results show that the current standard treatment protocol can be modified to produce cancer-free equilibrium for deeper cancer cells in the urothelium if the cancer cells’ spatial distribution is known, resulting in a greater success rate.",

         "description":"Multiple studies highlight the link between engagement at work and performance, influencing organizations to put more effort into improving employee engagement levels. In this study, we begin to examine the influence of multiple psychological parameters on employees’ work engagement (WE) within the public sector. The idea is to break the concept of WE down into eight individually measurable parameters that will allow for a better understanding and development of stronger interventions. Based on this analysis, we reproduce the outcome that strategic clarity is the most connected property to WE. More importantly, we introduce a new concept, honest mistakes, and show that having a safe space for making mistakes and learning from it is the second most important property of WE. This result is of interest, as allowing mistakes, even if they were made innocently, is considered taboo in the public sector. These outcomes are based on the reports of n=7682 public sector employees from Brazil. In particular, the analysis shows that these outcomes hold for both professional and management positions across the health, administrative, justice, police, social work, and education offices. ",

The aim of this study was to predict the occurrence of AKI following PN using preoperative parameters by applying machine learning algorithms. Methods We included all adult patients (n = 723) who underwent open PN in our department since 1995 and on whom we have data on the pre-operative renal function. We developed a random forest (RF) model with Boolean satisfaction-based pruned decision trees for binary classification (AKI or non-AKI). Hyper-parameter grid search was performed to optimize the model's performance. Fivefold cross-validation was applied to evaluate the model. We implemented a RF model with greedy feature selection to binary classify AKI and non-AKI cases based on pre-operative data. Results The best model obtained a 0.69 precision and 0.69 recall in classifying the AKI and non-AKI groups on average (k = 5). In addition, the model's probability to correctly classify a new prediction is 0.75. The proposed model is available as an online calculator. Conclusions Our model predicts the occurrence of AKI following open PN with (75%) accuracy. We plan to externally validate this model and modify it to minimally-invasive PN.",

While this new pedagogic paradigm (PP) holds a promise of better learning and training, it comes with challenges as traditional PPs are not suited to the new settings which highly differ from the physical classroom methods. We studied three online PPs (Synchronous, Asynchronous, and Asynchronous with an audience) and their influence on the students learning process and achievements during an academic mathematics course that was conducted online. 168 students took an exam and answered a questionnaire regarding their learning preferences, experience, and habits after experiencing one of these PPs. We found that students who studied according to the asynchronous with an audience PP achieved a higher score in the exam, regardless of their initial level than students who learned by either the synchronous or asynchronous PPs. In addition, we developed a personalized model based on machine learning methods that match an online PP for each student to maximize the student’s score in the exam. In the case of an academic mathematical course, the online PP had a major influence on the students’ scores in the exam. We found that students with high grades in previous courses preferred synchronous learning, which indicates the importance of picking the right online PP for each student. Our model provides a novel tool for the pedagogic community to personalize online learning by recommending the PP that could be most suitable for each student.",

         "description":"In recent years, much attention has been focused on the impact of climate change, particularly via ocean acidification (OA), on marine organisms. Studying the impact of OA on long-living organisms, such as sharks, is especially challenging. When the ocean waters absorb anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), slow-growing shark species with long generation times may be subjected to stress, leading to a decrease in functionality. Our goal was to examine the behavioral and physiological responses of sharks to OA and the possible impacts on their fitness and resilience. We conducted a systematic review in line with PRISMA-Analyses, of previously reported scientific experiments. We found that most studies used CO2 partial pressures (pCO2) that reflect representative concentration pathways for the year 2100 (e.g., pH ~7.8, pCO2 ~1000 μatm). Since there is a considerable knowledge gap on the effect of OA on sharks, we utilized existing data on bony fish to synthesize the available knowledge. Given the similarities between the behaviors and physiology of these two superclasses’ to changes in CO2 and pH levels, there is merit in including the available information on bony fish as well. Several studies indicated a decrease in shark fitness in relation to increased OA and CO2 levels. However, the decrease was species-specific and influenced by the intensity of the change in atmospheric CO2 concentration and other anthropogenic and environmental factors (e.g., fishing, temperature). Most studies involved only limited exposure to future environmental conditions and were conducted on benthic shark species studied in the laboratory rather than on apex predator species. While knowledge gaps exist, and more research is required, we conclude that anthropogenic factors are likely contributing to shark species’ vulnerability worldwide. However, the impact of OA on the long-term stability of shark populations is not unequivocal.",

Epidemiological models can be used to better understand pandemic dynamics and assist policymakers in optimizing their Intervention Policies (IPs). Most existing epidemiological models assume, sometimes incorrectly, that a pandemic is caused by a single pathogen, ignoring pathogen mutations over time that result in different pathogen variants with different characteristics. In addition, the existing models do not incorporate the effect of IPs like vaccinations and lockdowns during the fitting phase. In this work, we introduce a new multi-mutation model called Suspected-Infected-Vaccinated-Recovered-reInfected (SIVRI). This model extends the SIRS model with adaptation to incorporate available knowledge related to the different pathogen mutations together with multiple IPs. In order to find the model parameters we propose a new fitting procedure that supports the complex social, epidemiological, and clinical dynamics that occur during a pandemic. We examine the suggested SIVRI model in comparison to the SIRS and XGboost models on the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel that includes four COVID-19 mutations, and the vaccination and lockdown IPs. We show that the proposed model can fit accurately to the historical data and outperform the existing models in predictions of basic reproduction number, mortality rate, and severely infected individuals rate.",

In this study, we propose a spatio-temporal, heterogeneous population model and in silico simulation to evaluate pandemic IPs in four types of buildings - home, office, school, and mall. We show that indeed each building type has a unique pandemic spread and therefore a different optimal IP.

Most countries have adopted “lockdown” policies to reduce the spatial spread of COVID-19, but they have damaged the economic and moral fabric of society. Mathematical modeling in non-pharmaceutical intervention policy management has proven to be a major weapon in this fight due to the lack of an effective COVID-19 vaccine. We present a new \textit{hybrid} model for COVID-19 dynamics using both an age-structured mathematical model based on the SIRD model and spatio-temporal model in silico, analyzing the data of COVID-19 in Israel. Using the \textit{hybrid} model, we have introduced a method for estimating the reproduction number of an epidemic in real-time from the data of daily notification of cases. The results of the proposed model are confirmed by the Israeli Lockdown experience with a mean square error of 0.205 over two weeks. The use of mathematical models promises to reduce the uncertainty in the choice of “Lockdown” policies. Our unique use of contact details from 2 classes (children and adults), the interaction of populations depending on the time of day, and several physical locations, allowed a new look at the differential dynamics of the spread and control of infection.",

         "description":"We present a new analytical method to find the asymptotic stable equilibria states based on the Markov chain technique. We reveal this method on the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)-type epidemiological model that we developed for viral diseases with long-term immunity memory. This is a large-scale model containing 15 nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and classical methods have failed to analytically obtain its equilibria. The proposed method is used to conduct a comprehensive analysis by a stochastic representation of the dynamics of the model, followed by finding all asymptotic stable equilibrium states of the model for any values of parameters and initial conditions thanks to the symmetry of the population size over time.",
