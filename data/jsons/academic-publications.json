         "name":"Mathematical model of dating apps’ influence on sexually transmitted diseases spread",
         "description":"Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a group of pathogens infecting new hosts through sexual interactions. Due to its social and economic burden, multiple models have been proposed to study the spreading of pathogens. In parallel, in the ever-evolving landscape of digital social interactions, the pervasive utilization of dating apps has become a prominent facet of modern society. Despite the surge in popularity and the profound impact on relationship formation, a crucial gap in the literature persists regarding the potential ramifications of dating apps usage on the dynamics of STDs. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a novel mathematical framework - an extended Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemiological model to elucidate the intricate interplay between dating apps engagement and the propagation of STDs. Namely, as dating apps are designed to make users revisit them and have mainly casual sexual interactions with other users, they increase the number of causal partners, which increases the overall spread of STDS. Using extensive simulation, based on real-world data, explore the effect of dating apps adoption and control on the STD spread. We show that an increased adoption of dating apps can result in an STD outbreak if not handled appropriately.",

Detecting anomalies in temporal graphs is crucial for various applications, including identifying emerging trends, monitoring network security, understanding social dynamics, tracking disease outbreaks, and understanding financial dynamics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study that compares 12 data-driven methods for anomaly detection in temporal graphs. We conduct experiments on two temporal graphs extracted from Twitter and Facebook, aiming to identify anomalies in group interactions.

         "description":"Background: Lung cancer (LC) screening using low-dose computed tomography (CT) is recommended according to standard risk criteria or personalized risk calculators. Machine learning (ML) models that can predict disease risk are an emerging method in medicine for identifying hidden associations that are personally unique. Materials and methods: Using the tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT), we developed an ML-based model, which is an ensemble of the Random Forest and XGboost models, based on known risk factors for LC, as part of a larger trial for ML prediction using electronic medical records and chest CT. We used data from patients with LC vs. controls (1:2) of patients aged ≥ 35 years. We developed a model for all LC patients as well as for patients with and without a smoking background. We included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking history, socioeconomic status (SES), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema/chronic bronchitis (CB), interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pulmonary fibrosis (PF), and family history of LC. Results: Of the 4076 patients, 1428 (35 %) were in the LC group and 2648 (65 %) were in the control group. For the entire study population, our model achieved an accuracy of 71.2 %, with a sensitivity of 69 % and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 74 %. Higher accuracy was achieved for the two subgroups. An accuracy of 74.8 % (sensitivity 72 %, PPV 76 %) and 73.0 % (sensitivity 76 %, PPV 72 %) was achieved for the smoking and never-smoking cohorts, respectively. For the entire population and smoker cohort, COPD/emphysema/CB were the most important contributors, followed by BMI and age, while in the never-smoking cohort, BMI, age and SES were the most important contributors. Conclusion: Known risk factors for LC could be used in ML models to modestly predict LC. Further studies are needed to confirm these results in new patients and to improve them.",

         "description":"Navigation of male moths toward females during the mating search offers a unique perspective on the exploration-exploitation (EE) model in decision-making. This study uses the EE model to explain male moth pheromone-driven flight paths. Wind tunnel measurements and 3D tracking using infrared cameras have been leveraged to gain insights into male moth behavior. During the experiments in the wind tunnel, disturbance to the airflow has been added and the effect of increased fluctuations on moth flights has been analyzed, in the context of the proposed EE model. The exploration and exploitation phases are separated using a genetic algorithm to the experimentally-obtained dataset of moth 3D trajectories. First, the exploration-to-exploitation rate (EER) increases with distance from the source of the female pheromone is demonstrated, which can be explained in the context of the EE model. Furthermore, our findings reveal a compelling relationship between EER and increased flow fluctuations near the pheromone source. Using an olfactory navigation simulation and our moth-inspired navigation model, the phenomenon where male moths exhibit an enhanced EER as turbulence levels increase is explained. This research extends our understanding of optimal navigation strategies based on general biological EE models and supports the development of bio-inspired navigation algorithms.",

While ethical considerations underscore the importance of transparently acknowledging LLM use, especially in scientific communication, genuine acknowledgment remains infrequent. A potential avenue to encourage accurate acknowledging of LLM-assisted writing involves employing automated detectors. Our evaluation of four cutting-edge LLM-generated text detectors reveals their suboptimal performance compared to a simple ad-hoc detector designed to identify abrupt writing style changes around the time of LLM proliferation. We contend that the development of specialized detectors exclusively dedicated to LLM-assisted writing detection is necessary.

         "description":"In the realm of machine and deep learning (DL) regression tasks, the role of effective feature engineering (FE) is pivotal in enhancing model performance. Traditional approaches of FE often rely on domain expertise to manually design features for machine learning (ML) models. In the context of DL models, the FE is embedded in the neural network's architecture, making it hard for interpretation. In this study, we propose to integrate symbolic regression (SR) as an FE process before a ML model to improve its performance. We show, through extensive experimentation on synthetic and 21 real-world datasets, that the incorporation of SR-derived features significantly enhances the predictive capabilities of both machine and DL regression models with 34%–86% root mean square error (RMSE) improvement in synthetic datasets and 4%–11.5% improvement in real-world datasets. In an additional realistic use case, we show the proposed method improves the ML performance in predicting superconducting critical temperatures based on Eliashberg theory by more than 20% in terms of RMSE. These results outline the potential of SR as an FE component in data-driven models, improving them in terms of performance and interpretability.",

         "description":"Data encoding is a common and central operation in most data analysis tasks. The performance of other models downstream in the computational process highly depends on the quality of data encoding. One of the most powerful ways to encode data is using the neural network AutoEncoder (AE) architecture. However, the developers of AE cannot easily influence the produced embedding space, as it is usually treated as a black box technique. This means the embedding space is uncontrollable and does not necessarily possess the properties desired for downstream tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach for developing AE models that can integrate external knowledge sources into the learning process, possibly leading to more accurate results. The proposed Knowledge-integrated AutoEncoder (KiAE) model can leverage domain-specific information to make sure the desired distance and neighborhood properties between samples are preservative in the embedding space. The proposed model is evaluated on three large-scale datasets from three scientific fields and is compared to nine existing encoding models. The results demonstrate that the KiAE model effectively captures the underlying structures and relationships between the input data and external knowledge, meaning it generates a more useful representation. This leads to outperforming the rest of the models in terms of reconstruction accuracy.",

In Google Scholar, scholars can select a subset of co-authors for presentation in a central location on their profile using a social feature called the “co-authroship panel”.

To this end, we scrape and thoroughly analyze a novel set of 120,000 Google Scholar profiles, ranging across four dieffectsciplines and various academic institutions. Our results seem to suggest that scholars tend to favor co-authors with higher scientometrics over others for inclusion in their co-authorship panels.

The proposed two-phase deep learning model combines an AutoEncoder for feature representation and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for time-series prediction. We show it outperforms traditional linear regression models and current state-of-the-art machine learning-based models, offering a more accurate and reliable estimation.

Finding stable features is important for creating reliable, non-overfitted feature sets, which in turn can be used to generate machine learning models with better accuracy and explanations and are less prone to adversarial attacks. There are currently several definitions of FS stability that are widely used. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing stability metrics fail to quantify certain key elements of many datasets such as resilience to data drift or non-uniformly distributed missing values. To address this shortcoming, we propose a new definition for FS stability inspired by Lyapunov stability in dynamic systems. We show the proposed definition is statistically different from the classical record-stability on (n=90) datasets. We present the advantages and disadvantages of using Lyapunov and other stability definitions and demonstrate three scenarios in which each one of the three proposed stability metrics is best suited.",

The introduction of outside stimuli for dogs in this environment can improve their welfare and life conditions. However, our current understanding of the influence of different stimuli on shelter dogs’ welfare is limited and the data is still insufficient to draw conclusions. In this study, we collected 28 days (four weeks) of telemetry data from eight male dogs housed in an Italian shelter for a long period of time. During this period, three types of enrichment were introduced into the dogs’ pens for one week each: entertaining objects, intraspecific, and interspecific social enrichment, by means of the presence of female conspecifics and the presence of a human. To quantify their impact, we introduce novel metrics as indicators of sheltered dogs’ welfare based on telemetry data: the variation of heart rate, muscle activity, and body temperature from an average baseline day, quality of sleep, and the regularity for cyclicity of the aforementioned parameters, based on the day-night cycle. Using these metrics, we show that while all three stimuli statistically improve the dogs’ welfare, the variance between individual dogs is large. Moreover, our findings indicate that the presence of female conspecific is the best stimulus among the three explored options which improves both the quality of sleep and the parameters’ cyclicity. Our results are consistent with previous research findings while providing novel data-driven welfare indicators that promote objectivity.

One such promising approach is the use of vocal indicators. The acoustic structure of vocalizations and their functions were extensively studied in important livestock species, such as pigs, horses, poultry, and goats, yet cattle remain understudied in this context to date. Cows were shown to produce two types of vocalizations: low-frequency calls (LF), produced with the mouth closed, or partially closed, for close distance contacts, and open mouth emitted high-frequency calls (HF), produced for long-distance communication, with the latter considered to be largely associated with negative affective states. Moreover, cattle vocalizations were shown to contain information on individuality across a wide range of contexts, both negative and positive. Nowadays, dairy cows are facing a series of negative challenges and stressors in a typical production cycle, making vocalizations during negative affective states of special interest for research. One contribution of this study is providing the largest to date pre-processed (clean from noises) dataset of lactating adult multiparous dairy cows during negative affective states induced by visual isolation challenges. Here, we present two computational frameworks—deep learning based and explainable machine learning based, to classify high and low-frequency cattle calls and individual cow voice recognition. Our models in these two frameworks reached 87.2 and 89.4% accuracy for LF and HF classification, with 68.9 and 72.5% accuracy rates for the cow individual identification, respectively.",

However, the mechanics of particle-stratification interactions in various combinations of particle and fluid properties are not well understood. This study presents a novel machine-learning (ML) approach to experimental data of inertial particles crossing a density-stratified interface. A simplified particle settling experiment was conducted to obtain a large number of particles and expand the parameter range. Using ML, the study explores new correlations that collapse the data gathered in this and in previous work by Verso et al. (2019). The “delay time”, which is the time between the particle exiting the interfacial layer and reaching a steady-state velocity, is found to strongly depend on six dimensionless parameters formulated by ML feature selection. The data shows a correlation between the Reynolds and Froude numbers within the range of the experiments, and the best symbolic regression is based on the Froude number only. This experiment provides valuable insights into the behavior of inertial particles in stratified layers and highlights opportunities for future improvement in predicting their motion.",

OFEE uses intersections of feature sets to produce a feature ensemble that optimally balances explainability and performance. Furthermore, OFEE is parameter-free and as such optimizes itself to a given dataset and explainability requirements. To evaluated OFEE, we considered two explainability measures, one based on ensemble size and the other based on ensemble stability. We found that OFEE was overall extremely effective within the nine canonical datasets we considered. It outperformed other feature selection algorithms by an average of over 8% and 7% respectively when considering the size and stability explainability measures.",

         "description":"During a global health crisis, a country’s borders are a weak point through which carriers from countries with high morbidity rates can enter, endangering the health of the local community and undermining the authorities efforts to prevent the spread of the pathogen. Therefore, most countries have adopted some level of border closure policies as one of the first steps in handling pandemics. However, this step involves a significant economic loss, especially for countries that rely on tourism as a source of income. We developed a pioneering model to help decision-makers determine the optimal border closure policies during a health crisis that minimize the magnitude of the outbreak and maximize the revenue of the tourism industry. This approach is based on a hybrid mathematical model that consists of an epidemiological sub-model with tourism and a pandemic-focused economic sub-model, which relies on elements from the field of artificial intelligence to provide policymakers with a data-driven model for a border closure strategy for tourism during a global pandemic.",

         "description":"Behavioral traits in dogs are assessed for a wide range of purposes such as determining selection for breeding, chance of being adopted or prediction of working aptitude. Most methods for assessing behavioral traits are questionnaire or observation-based, requiring significant amounts of time, effort and expertise. In addition, these methods might be also susceptible to subjectivity and bias, negatively impacting their reliability. In this study, we proposed an automated computational approach that may provide a more objective, robust and resource-efficient alternative to current solutions. Using part of a ‘Stranger Test’ protocol, we tested n = 53 dogs for their response to the presence and neutral actions of a stranger. Dog coping styles were scored by three dog behavior experts. Moreover, data were collected from their owners/trainers using the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). An unsupervised clustering of the dogs’ trajectories revealed two main clusters showing a significant difference in the stranger-directed fear C-BARQ category, as well as a good separation between (sufficiently) relaxed dogs and dogs with excessive behaviors towards strangers based on expert scoring. Based on the clustering, we obtained a machine learning classifier for expert scoring of coping styles towards strangers, which reached an accuracy of 78%. We also obtained a regression model predicting C-BARQ scores with varying performance, the best being Owner-Directed Aggression (with a mean average error of 0.108) and Excitability (with a mean square error of 0.032). This case study demonstrates a novel paradigm of ‘machine-based’ dog behavioral assessment, highlighting the value and great promise of AI in this context.",

         "description":"The early and accurate diagnosis of brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) in dogs is pivotal for effective treatment and enhanced canine well-being. Owners often do underestimate the severity of BOAS in their dogs. In addition, traditional diagnostic methods, which include pharyngolaryngeal auscultation, are often compromised by subjectivity, are time-intensive and depend on the veterinary surgeon’s experience. Hence, new fast, reliable assessment methods for BOAS are required. The aim of the current study was to use machine learning techniques to bridge this scientific gap. In this study, machine learning models were employed to objectively analyze 366 audio samples from 69 Pugs and 79 other brachycephalic breeds, recorded with an electronic stethoscope during a 15-min standardized exercise test. In classifying the BOAS test results as to whether the dog is affected or not, our models achieved a peak accuracy of 0.85, using subsets from the Pugs dataset. For predictions of the BOAS results from recordings at rest in Pugs and various brachycephalic breeds, accuracies of 0.68 and 0.65 were observed, respectively. Notably, the detection of laryngeal sounds achieved an F1 score of 0.80. These results highlight the potential of machine learning models to significantly streamline the examination process, offering a more objective assessment than traditional methods. This research indicates a turning point towards a data-driven, objective, and efficient approach in canine health assessment, fostering standardized and objective BOAS diagnostics.",

Recently, there has been an increasing number of false claims found in academic manuscripts, casting doubt on the validity of reported results. In this paper, we utilize an adapted version of Benford’s law, a statistical phenomenon that describes the distribution of leading digits in naturally occurring datasets, to identify the potential manipulation of results in research manuscripts, solely using the aggregated data presented in those manuscripts rather than the commonly unavailable raw datasets. Our methodology applies the principles of Benford’s law to commonly employed analyses in academic manuscripts, thus reducing the need for the raw data itself. To validate our approach, we employed 100 open-source datasets and successfully predicted 79% of them accurately using our rules. Moreover, we tested the proposed method on known retracted manuscripts, showing that around half (48.6%) can be detected using the proposed method. Additionally, we analyzed 100 manuscripts published in the last two years across ten prominent economic journals, with 10 manuscripts randomly sampled from each journal. Our analysis predicted a 3% occurrence of results manipulation with a 96% confidence level. Our findings show that Benford’s law adapted for aggregated data, can be an initial tool for identifying data manipulation; however, it is not a silver bullet, requiring further investigation for each flagged manuscript due to the relatively low prediction accuracy.",

In this study, we propose a novel eco-epidemiological model that captures multi-species prey–predator dynamics with a multi-strain pandemic. The proposed model extends and combines the Lotka–Volterra prey–predator model and the Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered epidemiological model. We investigate the ecosystem’s sensitivity and stability during such a multi-strain pandemic through extensive simulation relying on both synthetic cases as well as two real-world configurations. Our results are aligned with known ecological and epidemiological findings, thus supporting the adequacy of the proposed model in realistically capturing the complex eco-epidemiological properties of the multi-species multi-strain pandemic dynamics.",

While multiple methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge, using snails as biological agents have shown to be the most consistent and promising approach. However, snails are an invasive species, and overusing them can cause devastating outcomes. In this paper, we develop and explore an ecological-epidemiological mathematical model for the coffee tree rust pandemic control using snails as biological agents. We analyze the equilibria of the proposed system with their stability properties. In addition, we perform numerical analysis to obtain the sensitivity of the system to different changes and manipulation of the snails pandemic control, under specific conditions. Finally, we propose an in silico mechanism to obtain an analytical connection between the system's initial condition and the number of snails needed to optimally control the rust pandemic spread while preventing the snail population to grow unmanageably. Our model can be used to optimize the usage of snails as biological agents to control the rust pandemic in spatially-small areas, by predicting the number of snails one needs to introduce to the ecosystem in order to obtain a desired outcome.",

These CM and collision avoidance (CA) behaviors are based on input from the environment such as smell, air pressure, and vision, all of which are processed by the individual and defined action. In this work, a novel vision-based CM with CA model (i.e., VCMCA) simulating the collective evolution learning process is proposed. In this setting, a learning agent obtains a visual signal about its environment, and throughout trial-and-error over multiple attempts, the individual learns to perform a local CM with CA which emerges into a global CM with CA dynamics. The proposed algorithm was evaluated in the case of locusts’ swarms, showing the evolution of these behaviors in a swarm from the learning process of the individual in the swarm. Thus, this work proposes a biologically-inspired learning process to obtain multi-agent multi-objective dynamics.",

Researchers have developed multiple mathematical models and computational frameworks to investigate and predict pandemic spread on various levels and scales such as countries, cities, large social events, and even buildings. However, attempts of modeling airborne pandemic dynamics on the smallest scale, a single room, have been mostly neglected. As time indoors increases due to global urbanization processes, more infections occur in shared rooms. In this study, a high-resolution spatio-temporal epidemiological model with airflow dynamics to evaluate airborne pandemic spread is proposed. The model is implemented, using Python, with high-resolution 3D data obtained from a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) device and computing model based on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for the airflow and the Susceptible–Exposed–Infected (SEI) model for the epidemiological dynamics. The pandemic spread is evaluated in four types of rooms, showing significant differences even for a short exposure duration. We show that the room’s topology and individual distribution in the room define the ability of air ventilation to reduce pandemic spread throughout breathing zone infection.",

The model focuses on assessing state tax revenues obtained from regions or cities within countries while introducing consumers and businesses, each with unique attributes and a decision-making mechanism driven by an adaptive genetic algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on a small village, resulting in a mean relative error of 5.44 +- 2.34 percent from the recorded taxes over 4 years and 4.08 +- 1.21 percent for the following year’s assessment.

Such frameworks intelligently search among millions of possible ML pipelines - typically containing feature engineering, model selection, and hyper parameters tuning steps - and finally output an optimal pipeline in terms of predictive accuracy. However, when the dataset is large, each individual configuration takes longer to execute, therefore the overall AutoML running times become increasingly high. To this end, we present SubStrat, an AutoML optimization strategy that tackles the data size, rather than configuration space. It wraps existing AutoML tools, and instead of executing them directly on the entire dataset, SubStrat uses a genetic-based algorithm to find a small yet representative data subset that preserves a particular characteristic of the full data. It then employs the AutoML tool on the small subset, and finally, it refines the resulting pipeline by executing a restricted, much shorter, AutoML process on the large dataset. ",

Thanks to technological advancements, many millions of healthy and diseased genomes have already been sequenced; however, obtaining the most suitable data for a specific study, and specifically for validation studies, remains challenging with respect to scale and access. Therefore, in silico genomics sequence generators have been proposed as a possible solution. However, the current generators produce inferior data using mostly shallow (stochastic) connections, detected with limited computational complexity in the training data. This means they do not take the appropriate biological relations and constraints, that originally caused the observed connections, into consideration. To address this issue, we propose cancer-inspired genomics mapper model (CGMM), that combines genetic algorithm (GA) and deep learning (DL) methods to tackle this challenge. CGMM mimics processes that generate genetic variations and mutations to transform readily available control genomes into genomes with the desired phenotypes. We demonstrate that CGMM can generate synthetic genomes of selected phenotypes such as ancestry and cancer that are indistinguishable from real genomes of such phenotypes, based on unsupervised clustering. Our results show that CGMM outperforms four current state-of-the-art genomics generators on two different tasks, suggesting that CGMM will be suitable for a wide range of purposes in genomic medicine, especially for much-needed validation studies.",

Traditional approaches to HSRA have relied on manual planning and ad-hoc adjustments, which can be time-consuming and usually lead to sub-optimal outcomes. Recent studies show that machine learning solutions are able to produce better HSRA results compared to manual planning. However, these outcomes usually focused on a single hospital and objective. In this paper, we solve the HSRA task using a novel agent-based simulation with a deep reinforcement learning agent. We used real-world data to generate a wide range of synthetic instances that were used to train the HSRA agent. Our results show that the proposed model is able to achieve better outcomes in terms of patient treatment success and cost-effectiveness compared to previous resource allocation algorithms. We show that different planning horizons obtain similar performance in handling anomalies. In addition, we show a second-order polynomial connection between the patient treatment success and both the hospital’s initial budget and funding over time. These results suggest that our approach has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HSRA in healthcare systems.",

Recently, with the advancement of machine learning (ML) and other artificial intelligence (AI) methods, researchers can now solve complex economic tasks with previously unseen performance and ease. However, to use such methods, one is required to have a non-trivial level of expertise in ML or AI, which currently is not standard knowledge in economics. In order to bridge this gap, automatic machine learning (AutoML) models have been developed, allowing non-experts to efficiently use advanced ML models with their data. Nonetheless, not all AutoML models are created equal in general, particularly for the unique properties associated with economic data. In this paper, we present a benchmarking study of biologically inspired and other AutoML techniques for economic tasks. We evaluate four different AutoML models alongside two baseline methods using a set of 50 diverse economic tasks. Our results show that biologically inspired AutoML models (slightly) outperformed non-biological AutoML in economic tasks, while all AutoML models outperformed the traditional methods. Based on our results, we conclude that biologically inspired AutoML has the potential to improve our economic understanding while shifting a large portion of the analysis burden from the economist to a computer.",

The proposed model extends and combines the Lotka–Volterra prey–predator model and the Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered epidemiological model. We investigate the ecosystem’s sensitivity and stability during such a multi-strain pandemic through extensive simulation relying on both synthetic cases as well as two real-world configurations.

The model takes into consideration the interaction network between multiple immune cell types and compartments. A set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is introduced to capture the connectivity between these variables and the clinical presentation of the disease. Four subsets of the T1D mice and healthy controls that exhibit normal and high-level glucose consumption are evaluated using the proposed model. Numerical results obtained for mice suggest that BCG treatment of the T1D patients that follow healthy eating habits normalizes glucose to levels observed in non-diabetic controls. Furthermore, glucose consumption profoundly influences disease progression. This outcome suggests that immunotherapy may modulate molecular and cellular manifestations of the disease but it does not eliminate T1D. Of note, our data, obtained from numerical simulations, indicate that the BCG immunotherapy treatment may benefit healthy controls on a high-glucose diet and can be used as a tool for further clinical investigation of BCG usage to control T1D.",

These models are commonly developed to provide decision-support tools for policymakers who are forced to make difficult decisions in a timely manner. Done properly, these models are able to provide a safe, quick, and cheap solution for this challenge. There are numerous types of mathematical models for epidemiological disease spread and control. However, in order to become applicative tools for decision-making, the modelers of these models are required to overcome three computational challenges: efficiently define the model, develop it as computer software, and fit it into historical data. Performed efficiently, one can use the obtained tool to explore possible scenarios and PIPs. In this paper, we present a critical review of models that extend the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and explore the efficiency of these models, their software characteristics, and model performance on real-world data. We further provide a guide for epidemiological-mathematical model development and implementation, exploring several modeling approaches and their respective implementation options. Lastly, we outline the current trends, limitations, and opportunities in this field. In particular, we find that the spatial properties of a model play a critical role in its accuracy and ability to explain historical pandemic spread, especially in the context of airborne diseases. Moreover, we show that agent-based simulations are preferable over partial/ordinary differential solvers when considering a highly-realistic pandemic model or focusing on a relatively small population size.",

We posit that, due to the influence of the filter FS on the embedded FS, one should aim to optimize both of them as a single FS pipeline rather than separately. We propose a meta-learning approach that automatically finds the best filter and embedded FS pipeline for a given dataset called FSPL. We demonstrate the performance of FSPL on n = 90 datasets, obtaining 0.496 accuracy for the optimal FS pipeline, revealing an improvement of up to 5.98 percent in the model’s accuracy compared to the second-best meta-learning method.",

The current treatment standard for BC follows a standard weekly Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy-based therapy protocol which includes BCG and IL-2 injections. Unfortunately, due to the biological and clinical complexity of the interactions between the immune system, treatment, and cancer cells, clinical outcomes vary significantly among patients. Unfortunately, existing models are commonly developed for a non-existing average patient or pose strict, unrealistic, expectations on the treatment process. In this work, we propose the most extensive ordinary differential equation-based biological model of BCG treatment to date and a deep learning-based scheduling approach to obtain a personalized treatment schedule.

Specifically, in the clinical domain, DTs have been widely used thanks to their relatively easy explainable nature, efficient computation time, and relatively accurate predictions. However, some DT constriction algorithms may produce a large tree size structure which is difficult to understand and often leads to misclassification of data in the testing process due to poor generalization. Post pruning (PP) algorithms have been introduced to reduce the size of the tree structure with a minor (or not at all) decrease in the accuracy of classification while trying to improve the model’s generalization. In this paper, we propose a new Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based PP algorithm called SAT-PP. Our algorithm reduces the tree size while preserving the accuracy of the unpruned tree. We implemented our algorithm on a medical-related classification data sets since in medical-related tasks we emphatically try to avoid decreasing the model’s performance when better training is not an option. Namely, in the case of medical-related tasks, one may prefer an unpruned DT model to a pruned DT model with worse performance. Indeed, we empirically obtained that the SAT-PP algorithm produce the same accuracy and F1 score as the DT model without PP while statistically significantly reducing the model size and as a result computation time (6.8%). In addition, we compared the proposed algorithm with other PP algorithms and found similar generalization capabilities.",

This study develops a pioneering mathematical model to quantify the role of pandemic-related intervention policies in the economic impact of a pandemic outbreak in an economy where sectors are complements throughout input-output networks. Our approach is based on three pillars - epidemiological, social, and economic sub-models. Moreover, we present in silico computer simulations to examine the influence of work capsules, work-from-home, vaccination, and industry closure on the damage a pandemic could inflict on output at the industry level. A comparison between work capsules and work-from-home policies shows that the latter decreases economic loss much more than the former. Compared to a state without interventions, a work-from-home policy affecting 12% of the workforce will decrease output loss by 1.4 percentage points during an epidemiological crisis following a COVID-19-like outbreak. Under the constraint of choosing one intervention policy, vaccination significantly reduces the loss of output, particularly in industries that require close customer-seller contacts. In the analysis of scenarios of integrating intervention policies, it is found that, using direct marginal contribution as the measure, the vaccination intervention is approximately 4.5 times more effective in reducing output loss than the work-from-home intervention.",

However, attempts of modeling airborne pandemic dynamics on the smallest scale, a single room, have been mostly neglected. As time indoors increases due to global urbanization processes, more infections occur in shared rooms. In this study, a high-resolution spatio-temporal epidemiological model with airflow dynamics to evaluate airborne pandemic spread is proposed. The model is implemented, using Python, with high-resolution 3D data obtained from a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) device and computing model based on the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model for the airflow and the Susceptible–Exposed–Infected (SEI) model for the epidemiological dynamics. The pandemic spread is evaluated in four types of rooms, showing significant differences even for a short exposure duration.

         "description":"A single paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For research articles, abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. We strongly encourage authors to use the following style of structured abstracts, but without headings: (1) Background: place the question addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; (2) Methods: describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; (3) Results: summarize the article’s main findings; (4) Conclusions: indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be an objective representation of the article, it must not contain results which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should not exaggerate the main conclusions. Airborne diseases cause high mortality and adverse socioeconomic consequences. Due to urbanization, more people spend more time indoors. According to recent research, air ventilation reduces long-range airborne transmission in indoor settings. However, air ventilation solutions often incur significant energy costs and ecological footprints. The trade-offs between energy consumption and pandemic control indoors have not yet been thoroughly analyzed. In this work, we use advanced sensors to monitor the energy consumption and pandemic control capabilities of an air-conditioning system, a pedestal fan, and an open window in hospital rooms, classrooms, and conference rooms. A simulation of an indoor airborne pandemic spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) is used to analyze the Pareto front. For the three examined room types, the Pareto front consists of all three air ventilation solutions, with some ventilation configurations demonstrating significant inefficiencies. Specifically, air-conditioning is found to be efficient only at a very high energy cost and fans seem to pose a reasonable alternative. To conclude, a more informed ventilation policy can bring about a more desirable compromise between energy consumption and pandemic spread control.",

         "description":"Mankind has struggled with pathogens throughout history. In this context, the contribution of vaccines to the continued economic and social prosperity of humanity is enormous, but it is constantly threatened by the development of vaccine-resistant strains of the pathogen. In this study, we investigate the usage of genomic sequencing tests to detect new strains of a pathogen in a multi-strain pandemic scenario using a mathematical–epidemiological–genomic–economic model. Our model provides a theoretical framework to explore the influence of an extensive number of pharmaceutical interventions in a dynamic multi-strain pandemic. Specifically, we show that while a genomic sequence testing policy can be both economically and epidemiologically efficient, a random sample of the population provides sub-optimal results. Moreover, we demonstrate that the optimal policy is sensitive to the social and economic settings of the population, and provide a machine learning based model that offers a solution to these challenges.",

         "description":"Bladder cancer is one of the most widespread types of cancer. Multiple treatments for non-invasive, superficial bladder cancer have been proposed over the last several decades with a weekly Bacillus Calmette–Guérin immunotherapy-based therapy protocol, which is considered the gold standard today. Nonetheless, due to the complexity of the interactions between the immune system, healthy cells, and cancer cells in the bladder’s microenvironment, clinical outcomes vary significantly among patients. Mathematical models are shown to be effective in predicting the treatment outcome based on the patient’s clinical condition at the beginning of the treatment. Even so, these models still have large errors for long-term treatments and patients that they do not fit. In this work, we utilize modern mathematical tools and propose a novel cell-level spatio-temporal mathematical model that takes into consideration the cell–cell and cell–environment interactions occurring in a realistic bladder’s geometric configuration in order to reduce these errors. We implement the model using the agent-based simulation approach, showing the impacts of different cancer tumor sizes and locations at the beginning of the treatment on the clinical outcomes for today’s gold-standard treatment protocol. In addition, we propose a genetic-algorithm-based approach to finding a successful and time-optimal treatment protocol for a given patient’s initial condition. Our results show that the current standard treatment protocol can be modified to produce cancer-free equilibrium for deeper cancer cells in the urothelium if the cancer cells’ spatial distribution is known, resulting in a greater success rate.",

         "description":"Multiple studies highlight the link between engagement at work and performance, influencing organizations to put more effort into improving employee engagement levels. In this study, we begin to examine the influence of multiple psychological parameters on employees’ work engagement (WE) within the public sector. The idea is to break the concept of WE down into eight individually measurable parameters that will allow for a better understanding and development of stronger interventions. Based on this analysis, we reproduce the outcome that strategic clarity is the most connected property to WE. More importantly, we introduce a new concept, honest mistakes, and show that having a safe space for making mistakes and learning from it is the second most important property of WE. This result is of interest, as allowing mistakes, even if they were made innocently, is considered taboo in the public sector. These outcomes are based on the reports of n=7682 public sector employees from Brazil. In particular, the analysis shows that these outcomes hold for both professional and management positions across the health, administrative, justice, police, social work, and education offices. ",

The aim of this study was to predict the occurrence of AKI following PN using preoperative parameters by applying machine learning algorithms. Methods We included all adult patients (n = 723) who underwent open PN in our department since 1995 and on whom we have data on the pre-operative renal function. We developed a random forest (RF) model with Boolean satisfaction-based pruned decision trees for binary classification (AKI or non-AKI). Hyper-parameter grid search was performed to optimize the model's performance. Fivefold cross-validation was applied to evaluate the model. We implemented a RF model with greedy feature selection to binary classify AKI and non-AKI cases based on pre-operative data. Results The best model obtained a 0.69 precision and 0.69 recall in classifying the AKI and non-AKI groups on average (k = 5). In addition, the model's probability to correctly classify a new prediction is 0.75. The proposed model is available as an online calculator. Conclusions Our model predicts the occurrence of AKI following open PN with (75%) accuracy. We plan to externally validate this model and modify it to minimally-invasive PN.",

We show that the proposed model fits well with epidemiological historical world health data over a long time period. From a theoretical point of view, we show that the increasing number of strains increases logarithmically the maximum number of infected individuals and the mean mortality rate.

While this new pedagogic paradigm (PP) holds a promise of better learning and training, it comes with challenges as traditional PPs are not suited to the new settings which highly differ from the physical classroom methods. We studied three online PPs (Synchronous, Asynchronous, and Asynchronous with an audience) and their influence on the students learning process and achievements during an academic mathematics course that was conducted online. 168 students took an exam and answered a questionnaire regarding their learning preferences, experience, and habits after experiencing one of these PPs. We found that students who studied according to the asynchronous with an audience PP achieved a higher score in the exam, regardless of their initial level than students who learned by either the synchronous or asynchronous PPs. In addition, we developed a personalized model based on machine learning methods that match an online PP for each student to maximize the student’s score in the exam. In the case of an academic mathematical course, the online PP had a major influence on the students’ scores in the exam. We found that students with high grades in previous courses preferred synchronous learning, which indicates the importance of picking the right online PP for each student. Our model provides a novel tool for the pedagogic community to personalize online learning by recommending the PP that could be most suitable for each student.",

         "description":"In recent years, much attention has been focused on the impact of climate change, particularly via ocean acidification (OA), on marine organisms. Studying the impact of OA on long-living organisms, such as sharks, is especially challenging. When the ocean waters absorb anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), slow-growing shark species with long generation times may be subjected to stress, leading to a decrease in functionality. Our goal was to examine the behavioral and physiological responses of sharks to OA and the possible impacts on their fitness and resilience. We conducted a systematic review in line with PRISMA-Analyses, of previously reported scientific experiments. We found that most studies used CO2 partial pressures (pCO2) that reflect representative concentration pathways for the year 2100 (e.g., pH ~7.8, pCO2 ~1000 μatm). Since there is a considerable knowledge gap on the effect of OA on sharks, we utilized existing data on bony fish to synthesize the available knowledge. Given the similarities between the behaviors and physiology of these two superclasses’ to changes in CO2 and pH levels, there is merit in including the available information on bony fish as well. Several studies indicated a decrease in shark fitness in relation to increased OA and CO2 levels. However, the decrease was species-specific and influenced by the intensity of the change in atmospheric CO2 concentration and other anthropogenic and environmental factors (e.g., fishing, temperature). Most studies involved only limited exposure to future environmental conditions and were conducted on benthic shark species studied in the laboratory rather than on apex predator species. While knowledge gaps exist, and more research is required, we conclude that anthropogenic factors are likely contributing to shark species’ vulnerability worldwide. However, the impact of OA on the long-term stability of shark populations is not unequivocal.",

Epidemiological models can be used to better understand pandemic dynamics and assist policymakers in optimizing their Intervention Policies (IPs). Most existing epidemiological models assume, sometimes incorrectly, that a pandemic is caused by a single pathogen, ignoring pathogen mutations over time that result in different pathogen variants with different characteristics. In addition, the existing models do not incorporate the effect of IPs like vaccinations and lockdowns during the fitting phase. In this work, we introduce a new multi-mutation model called Suspected-Infected-Vaccinated-Recovered-reInfected (SIVRI). This model extends the SIRS model with adaptation to incorporate available knowledge related to the different pathogen mutations together with multiple IPs. In order to find the model parameters we propose a new fitting procedure that supports the complex social, epidemiological, and clinical dynamics that occur during a pandemic. We examine the suggested SIVRI model in comparison to the SIRS and XGboost models on the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel that includes four COVID-19 mutations, and the vaccination and lockdown IPs. We show that the proposed model can fit accurately to the historical data and outperform the existing models in predictions of basic reproduction number, mortality rate, and severely infected individuals rate.",

         "description":"We have developed an extended mathematical graph-based spatial-temporal SIR model, allowing a multidimensional analysis of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the pandemic spread, while assessing the economic losses caused by it. By incorporating into the model dynamics that are a consequence of the interrelationship between the pandemic and the economic crisis, such as job separation not as a result of workers’ morbidity, analysis were enriched. Controlling the spread of the pandemic and preventing outbreaks have been investigated using two NPIs: the duration of working and school days and lockdown to varying degrees among the adult and children populations. Based on the proposed model and data from the Israeli economy, allowing 7.5 working hours alongside 4.5 school hours would maximise output and prevent an outbreak, while minimising the death toll (0.48% of the population). Alternatively, an 89% lockdown among children and a 63% lockdown among adults will minimise the death toll (0.21%) while maximising output and preventing outbreaks.",

         "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a rolling crisis that required policymakers around the world to take action to manage the pandemic spread. During the period where vaccination was not available, the pandemic spread management lied in Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). A large number of mathematical models have been proposed to predict the pandemic spread and analyze the influence of various NPIs on multiple scenarios, getting more accurate and sophisticated over time. In this work, we review the latest mathematical models for pandemic spread NPIs and their main shortages. Specifically, the usage of modeling a homogeneous population rather than a heterogeneous one.",

         "description":"The new COVID-19 pandemic has challenged policymakers on key issues. Most countries have adopted “lockdown” policies to reduce the spatial spread of COVID-19, but they have damaged the economic and moral fabric of society. Mathematical modeling in non-pharmaceutical intervention policy management has proven to be a major weapon in this fight due to the lack of an effective COVID-19 vaccine. We present a new \textit{hybrid} model for COVID-19 dynamics using both an age-structured mathematical model based on the SIRD model and spatio-temporal model in silico, analyzing the data of COVID-19 in Israel. Using the \textit{hybrid} model, we have introduced a method for estimating the reproduction number of an epidemic in real-time from the data of daily notification of cases. The results of the proposed model are confirmed by the Israeli Lockdown experience with a mean square error of 0.205 over two weeks. The use of mathematical models promises to reduce the uncertainty in the choice of “Lockdown” policies. Our unique use of contact details from 2 classes (children and adults), the interaction of populations depending on the time of day, and several physical locations, allowed a new look at the differential dynamics of the spread and control of infection.",

We reveal this method on the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)-type epidemiological model that we developed for viral diseases with long-term immunity memory. This is a large-scale model containing 15 nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and classical methods have failed to analytically obtain its equilibria. The proposed method is used to conduct a comprehensive analysis by a stochastic representation of the dynamics of the model, followed by finding all asymptotic stable equilibrium states of the model for any values of parameters and initial conditions thanks to the symmetry of the population size over time.",
